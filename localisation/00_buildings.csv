wonder_black_pyramid;Black Pyramid of Nagash;;;;;;;;x
wonder_black_pyramid_desc;The Black Pyramid was built by slaves brought to Khemri from all over Nehekhara. Made from stone the colour of ebony, it is not just a monument to Nagash's pride, it was designed to store death magic and to amplify his powers.;;;;;;;;x
wonder_inevitable_city;Inevitable City;;;;;;;;x
wonder_inevitable_city_desc;The Inevitable City is one of the few places where Daemons of all four Gods of Chaos can be found,tormenting the lost souls who become unwittingly ensnared by the paths that lead to the city. Other servants of the Ruinous Powers congregate within its walls and plot the downfall of the old world.;;;;;;;;x
wonder_phoenix_gate;Phoenix Gate;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_phoenix_gate_desc;The Phoenix Gate was well named, for over the course of its existence it has been reduced to ruble and rebuilt on several occasions. Yet its garrison are little worried by this seemingly grim record. A great many of the Phoenix Gate's soldiers are drawn from the Kingdom of Eataine, and they simply assume such woes to be part of Asuryan's ineffable plan. 'Should the enemy topple our walls,' they say 'then we shall simply build them higher and grander than before.' And so they have, many times. Indeed, the towers of the Phoenix Gate now stand so tall that their spires are lost within the clouds that hang heavy about the Annulii Mountains.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_dragon_gate;Dragon Gate;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_dragon_gate_desc;The Dragon Gate is the largest and grandest of all Ulthuan's fortresses. When Caledor the Conqueror laid down the foundations of the great gates, he knew he would been unable to spend much time at court in Lothern, so enshrined the Dragon Gate as his war capital. He ordered a great palace be built into the heart of the fortress. The Dragon Gate's garrison too was established on a suitably grand scale, with near twice as many soldiers under arms as any two of the other great gates combined. Such an obvious display of martial pride soon proved an irresistible lure to the Dark Elves, and within a decade of the Dragon Gate's completion, no fewer than six of Malekith's armies broke themselves upon its walls. Now, like much of Ulthuan, the Dragon Gate is only sparsely occupied.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_unicorn_gate;Unicorn Gate;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_unicorn_gate_desc;The Unicorn Gate guards the longest and most treacherous of the mountain passes. As a result, it has seen less conflict than its sister fortresses — even the most determined of Dark Elf attackers see little purpose in breaching the Unicorn Gate simply to fight their way through the Harpy- and Cockatrice-haunted ravines that lie beyond. For all this, the garrison of the Unicorn Gate are no less tested than those of other strongholds, for they are under constant attack by the denizens of the very pass they guard.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_griffon_gate;Griffon Gate;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_griffon_gate_desc;The Griffon Gate is the oldest of Ulthuan's great mountain fortresses. It is also held to be unlucky by those who serve within it, for it always seems that foes besiege the Griffon Gate long before they consider carrying their blades against its sister fortresses. Yet the Griffon Gate's defenders forgive their fortress its odd fortunes, for there is still honour to be earned upon its walls. Furthermore, to be present upon the walls of the Griffon Gate at sunrise, it is said, is to be reminded of the Golden Age of the Elves, and to know one's hope reborn.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_eagle_gate;Eagle Gate;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_eagle_gate_desc;From atop the Eagle Gate, one can catch the scent of the sea, a dark and musky aroma that sends a chill down one's spine as one thinks of the cold, evil lands that lay beyond it. In stark contrast, if one turns eastward, one can see the rolling steppes of Ellyrion as a golden brown haze, its bounteous lands warming the heart of many who keep watch this high up in the mountains.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_druchii_watchtower;Watch Towers of Naggaroth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_druchii_watchtower_desc;Naggaroth is a land in little danger of invasion. Few enemy fleets survive more than a few hours in its corsair-infested waters, let alone long enough to close with the jagged coast and land troops. The only real danger comes from hordes of Chaos that roam the frozen wastelands to the north. The Naggarothi have founded many great citadels to hold the hordes of Northmen at bay. Each of these Watchtowers is the size of a city, provisioned to withstand years of siege and garrisoned with a great host of Naggaroth's foremost warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_black_tower;The Black Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_black_tower_desc;At the center of Naggarond stands the Black Tower. No mere fortress is this, but a city within a city -- a maze of palaces, ramparts and towers huddle within its curtain walls and jut from its sheer sides. Here dwell those nobles held highest in Malekith's regard -- an honour that brings wealth and patronage, but also danger. The Witch King has ever been a volatile monarch, generous when fortune smiles, but unflinchingly merciless when all does not go his way. Naggarond's court is therefore a place of rapid rises and meteoric descents -- few can play this game of politics for long, and none who take part die a natural death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_ghrond;Ghrond;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_ghrond_desc;The Tower of Ghrond is home to the feared Sorceresses of Naggaroth, long ruled by their Queen Morathi, mother of Malekith himself. It is a near impenetrable fortress, and the last line of defense against the hordes of the northern Chaos Wastes, should the watch towers fail to hold them back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_gallows_tree;Gallows Tree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_gallows_tree_desc;The Gallows Tree is a warped and horrific entity in its own right. Its tangled limbs are coiled and spread as if distorted in pain and held high above a rot-strewn swamp of vine-choked thorns, looming higher than a Temple's steeple above the desolate wastes. Foul and unutterable things dwell beneath its canopy, the tree being a living gateway to the horrors beyond this plane of reality. It is said that within lies an unclean hag-daemon, shunned even by her own kind, who will bestow hidden secrets and dark prophecy on those who please her. Those however who fail to meet her standards of devotion to Father Nurgle end their time as grisly adornments hanging from the boughs of the great tree above, food for maggots and crows alike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zanbaijin;Arena of Zanbaijin;;;;;;;;;x
zanbaijin_desc;Zanbaijin,the ancient city older than the race of Men itself, which had long served as an arena for the favoured champions of Chaos to prove themselves worthy of the favour of their masters. By the ancient traditions of the Norse, Kurgan and Hung, the victor of the great battle fought at Zanbaijin would become master of all the warbands he had vanquished. The fame of such a warlord would travel far in the northern wastes, drawing untold thousands to his war banner with the promise of glory and battle to come.;;;;;;;;;x
skavenblight;Skavenblight;;;;;;;;;x
skavenblight_desc;Skavenblight is the foul heart of the Skaven Under-Empire and the birthplace of the Skaven race. Through magics more powerful than the unsuspecting world can imagine, the largest and most densely populated city in the world is kept secret, its locations only guessed at by the very wisest of mortal-kind. Deep in the rotting heart of the Blighted Marsh festers the vile capital of the ratmen, the decay-ridden nexus of all Skavendom. This shell of a once-glorious city of mankind lies more than half sunken in the morass, a testimony to the corruption and ruin spread by the Children of the Horned Rat.;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_fortress;Chaos Fortress;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_fortress_desc;The Chaos Wastes serve as the principle arena of the mortal world in which the Dark Gods of Chaos play out their apocalyptic struggle for supremacy known to scholars of Daemon-lore as the Great Game. Amidst the impossible landscape, the armies of the Dark Gods clash in never-ending battles. These wars are fought not for glory, nor plunder, but simply to advance the unknowable designs of the Four. Every day, the Wastes rock and shudder with titanic conflicts the likes of which unmatched by even the most incredible battles of the Old World. Champions of these battle build great strongholds and dark temples to their gods.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_al_haikk;Al-Haikk;;;;;;;;;x
ca_al_haikk_desc;Al-Haikk is traditionally the capital of Araby, whenever the nation is united. Once known as the "Jewel of Araby", the city has declined importance in recent years, with continued wars, disasters and sieges targeting it due its source of legitimacy as the seat of the Great Sultan of All-Araby. While it's usually called the "City of Thieves" nowadays, due to the rampant depopulation - and thievery - in some of its old quarters, and overshadowed by other thriving rival cities, it remains a prestigious location to all Arabyans.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lashiek;Lashiek;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lashiek_desc;The City of Corsairs is the centre of trade between the North and Araby. Befitting its status as the face of the Arabyan Empire, Lashiek is a spacious city of surpassing beauty - but it is also home to ruthless pirates and the greatest thieves in all the world.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_istrabul;Istrabul;;;;;;;;;x
ca_istrabul_desc;From the Peacock Palace, the Sultan of Istrabul rules over one of the most wondrous cities of mankind. Istrabul is a city planned by the finest architects and built by combination of skilled labour and magical assistance. To Arabyans proper, it is an upstart, but none can deny the sparkling brilliance of the City of Man's Desire.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_copher;Copher;;;;;;;;;x
ca_copher_desc;Fabulous wealth from its spice gardens have allowed Copher certain liberties in politics and education. The city is home to many scholars and attracts many learned men from other realms.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_martek;Martek;;;;;;;;;x
ca_martek_desc;Nestled into the Atalan Mountains and straddling key caraven routes, Martek is both rich and highly defensible.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_el_kalabad;El-Kalabad;;;;;;;;;x
ca_el_kalabad_desc;Strengthened by magic to create a bulwark against the undead, El-Kalabad is the greatest fortress in Araby.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_al_aliman;Al-Aliman;;;;;;;;;x
ca_al_aliman_desc;Al-Aliman is an Arabyan Colony founded by Atruhayid corsairs, fierce mariners who still follow the old ways of Araby. Another recent colony with more spirit and ambition than solid power or wealth, it serves as a central hub of Old Worlder activity in southern Lustria. With spices and other exotic wares flowing through, and more and more adventurers and misfits arriving in search of adventure, the future of Al-Aliman seems promising and more importantly, profitable. It also fields famed Arabyan stallions, some of the finest horses in Lustria, not that there are many others to compete against!;;;;;;;;;x

ca_arabyan_qassabah_5;Arabyan Ksar;;;;;;;;;x
ca_arabyan_qassabah_6;Arabyan Ksar;;;;;;;;;x
ca_arabyan_qassabah_1_desc;The Arabyan Ksar, or "citadel" in the Imperial tongue, is the central administration complex for all Arabyan military settlements. While the Ksar is the military might of the Arabyans, their architecture is legendary, full of impossible shapes, domed-roof buildings, and a myriad of spires, all linked with small walkways to get to-and-from. This not only serves to appease foreign emissaries, but to provide a confusing, maze-like structure, making it difficult for invaders to successfully take an Arabyan settlement.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tarikahwarriors_1;Tarikah Barracks;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tarikahwarriors_2;Tarikah Barracks;;;;;;;;;x

ca_tarikahwarriors_5;Tarikah Barracks;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tarikahwarriors_6;Tarikah Barracks;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tarikahwarriors_1_desc;The Tarikah are lightly armored sword-and-bow infantry units that act as the mainstay for any Arabyan army. While Araby fields the finest cavalry in the Human world, their infantry are nothing to scoff at, as the art of sword dancing and the skills of their bowmen are impressive.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_shushtar_1;Shushtar Warriors;;;;;;;;;x

ca_shushtar_4;Shushtar Warriors;;;;;;;;;x
ca_shushtar_5;Shushtar Warriors;;;;;;;;;x
ca_shushtar_6;Shushtar Warriors;;;;;;;;;x
ca_shushtar_1_desc;The Shushtar used to be an ancient Arabyan tribe that used mounted archery and lightning fast cavalry strikes to great effect against the old Nehekharan empire. While their tribe would eventually perish, their fighting style would not, and the Nomadic Nehekkas, Tevari, and the Urban Ramaccans now use it to once again wreak havoc onto their foes.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_shariati_5;Shariati Heavy Cavalry;;;;;;;;;x
ca_shariati_6;Shariati Heavy Cavalry;;;;;;;;;x
ca_shariati_1_desc;The Shariati are the 'heavy' cavalry components of Cophic and nomadic Arabyan armies. Unlike the Shushtar, who use mounted archery and harass tactics, the Shariati make use of the sturdy Arabyan camel to deliver devastating charges unto enemy lines. It is also known that foreign horses(those that are not native to Araby) are afraid of camels due to their smell, and so the camel cavalry was also initially the reason for many Arabyan victories during the crusades.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_ramaccan_jannisaries_5;Ramaccan Janissaries;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ramaccan_jannisaries_1_desc;The Ramaccan Janissary is the penultimate, modern Arabyan warrior. Raised from a young age to be a killing machine, these soldiers are of the highest quality an Arabyan lord can field, and normally serve as his or her bodyguards and elite detachments in the field of battle. Heavily armed, incredibly disciplined, these warriors make short work of anyone foolish enough to stand in their path.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_cophic_mamluks_4;Cophic Cataphracts;;;;;;;;;x
ca_cophic_mamluks_5;Cophic Cataphracts;;;;;;;;;x
ca_cophic_mamluks_1_desc;The Cataphract is an old Cophic idea made new. Much like the Ramaccan Jannisary, the Cophic Cataphract is an elite warrior of mostly noble stock, given the finest weapons, armor, steeds, and training to create a terrifying mounted warrior capable of smashing through enemy lines with frightening speed and grace.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_medean_warelephant_4;Medean War-Elephants;;;;;;;;;x
ca_medean_warelephant_5;Medean War-Elephants;;;;;;;;;x
ca_medean_warelephant_1_desc;Due to the many colonies established by the Medeans in the Southlands, their various city-states can field the impressive Southland Elephants, gigantic beasts of war from deep within the jungles of the south. These elephants are accompanied by Southland tribesmen, who paint various symbols and images onto their elephants to intimidate and frighten their enemies.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tevari_sanddevils_1;Sand Devils;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tevari_sanddevils_2;Sand Devils;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tevari_sanddevils_3;Sand Devils;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tevari_sanddevils_4;Sand Devils;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tevari_sanddevils_5;Sand Devils;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tevari_sanddevils_1_desc;In the harsh deserts and sand dunes of Araby and Nehekhara, heavy armour and infantry are mostly impractical. Due to this, and the nature of the lifestyle of the Tevari and Nehekkas, most of their number fight on horseback. Lightly armored, these warriors are quick enough to chase down even mounted skirmishers.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_arabnyancaravan_1;Grand Caravansary;;;;;;;;;x
ca_arabnyancaravan_2;Great Caravansary;;;;;;;;;x
ca_arabnyancaravan_1_desc;Found almost everywhere in Araby, the caravansary is the lifeblood of trade. It functions much like a marketplace from foreign lands, but larger, and full of exotic foods, crafts, people and creatures.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_arabyancorsairs_2;Corsairs of Araby;;;;;;;;;x
ca_arabyancorsairs_3;Corsairs of Araby;;;;;;;;;x
ca_arabyancorsairs_4;Corsairs of Araby;;;;;;;;;x

ct_cavalrystables_5;Arabyan Cavalry Militia;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cavalrystables_1_desc;While most soldiers raised in Arabyan cities are militia units, one should not mistake these riders as amateur or of poor quality. Horsemanship is a very serious and respected skill in Araby, and those cavalry units raised here are of no lesser quality than those trained in the Ksars.;;;;;;;;;x

ct_grandbazaar_6;Great Bazaar;;;;;;;;;x
ct_grandbazaar_1_desc;While many would say that the towering spires of the Ksars, or the daemonic, spell-bounded Djinn are what Araby is most known for, it is instead their cities' great bazaars, magnificent sections of Arabyan cities, mostly open air, full of exotic goods, everyday supplies, and of course, many stalls full of crafts and goods of questionable quality and authenticity.;;;;;;;;;x

ct_arabyan_cities_1_desc;Arabyans are know for two things, their horsemen, and their caravans. Here, in the beautiful cities that hug the deserts or sea-sides, the vast majority of caravans end up at. Much like the Ksars, the architecture of an Arabyan city makes it very difficult to siege properly.;;;;;;;;;x

ct_urbanmilitia_1_desc;Here is where an Arabyan city's foot-bound militia units are trained and housed. Armed with bows, spears, and swords, these militia units can hold their own in the field of battle, and can also reliably police Arabyan cities.;;;;;;;;;x
ct_southland_elephant_1;Southlander Quarters;;;;;;;;;x
ct_southland_elephant_2;Southlander Quarters;;;;;;;;;x
ct_southland_elephant_3;Southlander Quarters;;;;;;;;;x
ct_southland_elephant_4;Southlander Quarters;;;;;;;;;x
ct_southland_elephant_1_desc;Due to the closeness of the Southlands and Araby, -not just geographically speaking- most, if not all Arabyan cities have city quarters inhabited by Southlanders. While this may seem innocent at first, these quarters more often than not are poorly maintained, and lawless, save for one part, the War-Elephant pens. Great care is taken in maintaining these pens, for should an Elephant get lose in a city, it could be disastrous.;;;;;;;;;x

tp_grandlibrary_1_desc;The Grand Library is the center of most Arabyan scholarship, be it scientific or religious in nature. Here, one can find a vast array of books written by scientists, philosophers, mathematicians, and even theologians in the great halls of the library, as well as a secret vault designed to house the Djinni, spell-bound daemons used by scholars as guards, or in times of war, soldiers.;;;;;;;;;x

tp_phoneixguard_1_desc;The Burning Scimitars are an elite fighting forces stationed inside the Arabyan Grand Libraries. They are mostly composed of veterans of previous wars, thus making them stubborn defenders should the library come under attack, or if the scholars lose control of their Djinni.;;;;;;;;;x

tp_arabyan_stallions_1_desc;Just outside the library, in a separate building live the stallions ridden into battle by the Burning Scimitars' mounted counterparts. Due to the power the libraries hold over Araby, they are given the best equipment and training, even if they are not the sons of a rich merchant or noble.;;;;;;;;;x

tp_fine_arts_1_desc;The library is not all study and work, for fine art faculties also set up inside the building. While most of their work is for the people of Araby, a fraction of their crafts are actually vessels used by the scholars to spell-bind daemons to objects, so that they may be controlled and used against the enemies of Araby.;;;;;;;;;x

tp_the_forge_of_starlight;The Forge of Starlight;;;;;;;;;x
tp_the_forge_of_starlight_desc;The Forge is Starlight is the home for craftsmen and artisans alike within Athel Loren. At the heart of this realm lies one of the legendary Anvils of Vaul,whose roaring fires light up the forest every night to forge only the greatest of equipment for Wood Elf kinbands. Vaul's Anvil also acts as a temple to Vaul himself and so it is one of the few locations within Athel Loren where fire is sacred.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_oak_of_ages;The Oak of Ages;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_oak_of_ages_desc;The Oak of Ages is the beating heart of Athel Loren and the place where the Wood Elf realm was truly established. It is here that Ariel holds her court during the Summer months , disappearing inside the huge tree with Orion's ashes during the Winter, what occurs or even just what lies inside of the tree is unknown to all but Ariel and only a few other rare souls. The Winds of Magic are drawn to the tree and can alter its appearance depending on which wind is blowing strongest at that time, it is often said that a single acorn from the tree will have more magical power than most artifacts crafted by mortal races. Given the immense importance of the Oak of Ages, the Asrai will defend it more heavily than anywhere else in the forest, giving up their lives more than willingly to protect it.;;;;;;;;;x
tb_wydrioth;Wydrioth;;;;;;;;;x
tb_wydrioth_desc;The pine crags of Wydrioth are a realm under constant threat of invasion thanks to the dwarfs and Greenskins pouring down from the Grey Mountains. Its steep mountain slopes appear to be no more dangerous than anywhere else in Athel Loren, it is only when the invader moves beneath the eaves of the forest that they come across its true nature. Here the Asrai have shaped a whole fortress out of their sacred forest. Entire strongholds created out of massive oaks and a maze of rockbriar forming tangled and gnarled walls, all linked together by endless treetop walkways and tunnels fashioned out of the tree roots. This living defence has thrown back many a prospective Dwarf and even standing firm against a mighty Waaagh! The elves of this region are even more bloodthirsty and unkind to strangers than their kin, often cutting the attacking forces down to the last snotling.;;;;;;;;;x
tb_cavaroc;Cavaroc;;;;;;;;;x
tb_cavaroc_desc;The Elves living in Skymark Reaches in the realm of Cavaroc are famed horsemasters, swift to attack and swift to anger, they will always be at the forefront of Athel Loren's armies when the forest is roused to war. The finest horses in the whole of Athel Loren are raised here thanks to the fact that this realm is one of the few which is sparsely-wooded, covered in rolling grass plains instead.;;;;;;;;;x
tb_atylwyth;Atylwyth;;;;;;;;;x
tb_atylwyth_desc;The realm of Atylwyth has been locked in the cold embrace of winter for an eternity, each tree coated in a thick glazing of frost and every glade heavy with deep snow. Only a rare few forest spirits dwell in this icy part of the forest and these few that remain slumber through the ages. As a result of this disconnection from the forest, the elves of Atylwyth are highly militant, boasting one of the largest and most well trained force of Eternal Guard in the whole of Athel Loren for they are the only force willing to protect this part of the great forest.;;;;;;;;;x
tb_yn_edryl_koiran;The Kings Glade;;;;;;;;;x
tb_yn_edryl_koiran_desc;Yn Edryl Koiran, otherwise known as the King's Glade, is an immense and awe-inspiring clearing at the heart of Athel Loren in the realm of Talsyn. Ever since the Elves first entered Athel Loren this glade has been the centre of their civilisation, holding council here even before Ariel and Orion arrived. Over the centuries Spellweavers have crafted a great city in the ancient oaks that surround the glade, buildings and chambers made out of the living trees everywhere from their roots to the tree branches. To the unawary visitor, the city is invisible thanks to most of the inhabitants living either beneath the ground or above their heads as well as the centuries of magic woven into the area. The King's Glade is also where Ariel and Orion rule with the aid of their council made up of fifteen lord and ladies from the forest realm, an extraordinarily prestigious post for any Asrai to hold.;;;;;;;;;x

# BRETONNIAN UNIQUE BUILDINGS/WONDERS
#
wonder_couronne;Couronne;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_couronne_desc;The traditional capital of Bretonnia, Couronne is a large sprawling city heavily protected by a formidable series of bastions and towers spread out over the high walls. At the centre of the city lies the king's palace, a large citadel which allows the monarch to observe the lowly peasants beneath them from a safe distance. The city of Couronne also stands out for being one of the few clean cities in Bretonnia, something it owes to the great temple of Shallya and to the natural springs which can be found throughout the city.It is commonly said that the people of Couronne are born in the saddle, an exaggeration but one that holds some element of truth as the Couronnians are famed throughout the land as experts on equine matters. Other Bretonnians would call them obsessed with horses but even they cannot question the fine skill of Couronnian horsemen.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_languille;L'Anguille;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_languille_desc;First established by the High Elves as a trading port, the city of L'Anguille is truly one of the wonders of the Old World and still one of the main trading ports. The most obvious landmark in the city is that of the three-hundred feet tall lighthouse and the high walls that extend from it to surround the city. Both walls and lighthouse were constructed by the Elves and so bear the familiar signs of their fine craftsmanship which stands in stark contrast to the more recent and human built buildings within the walls. The oldest of the buildings inside the walls is castle itself which is located on a small island in the middle of the harbour, commanding the entire bay with its impressive defences.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_brionne;Brionne;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_brionne_desc;Much like the other cities in the dukedom, Brionne is a city based around beauty rather than practicality. Nevertheless, the castle at the heart of the city remains a surprisingly well-defended fortress despite its beautiful exterior. The entire city is set upon a hilly peninsula that is only joint to the mainland through a narrow and easily defended neck, the land around forming a natural harbour. Due to the regions strategic position, the Dukes of Brionne are tasked with maintaining a fleet of warships to patrol the southern coast from whomever would disturb the realm.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_lyonesse;Castle Lyonesse;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_lyonesse_desc;Castle Lyonesse is located on the north-west coast of Bretonnia, built upon a large island just off the mainland. As a result of this naturally defensive position, the castle is heavily fortified both by its natural defenses and those established by the Duke such as the huge keep at the peak of the island. At the high tide it is possible for small boats to sail right up into the outer courtyards whilst at low tide the sea sweeps back revealing ruins on the sea bed, thus any invading army must time their attack to avoid being stuck in either the high or low tides.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_bordeleaux;Bordeleaux;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_bordeleaux_desc;The bustling port of Bordeleaux holds much in common with many of the other major ports in Bretonnia being built off of ancient Elven ruins from the time long ago where they lorded over this land. The mighty castle of the Duke rests atop a cliff that rises over the main harbour, the countless siege weapons on its walls being able to reach any point in the city and the bay. Over the years, Bordeleaux has found itself in an ongoing commercial rivalry between itself and the great northern port of L'Anguille, a rivalry that Bordeleaux has always been on the losing end of.;;;;;;;;;x,
wonder_montfort;Montfort;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_montfort_desc;The castle and town of Montfort are located on the Bretonnian side of the Axe Bite Pass, a crucial defensive location against both greenskins attacking from the grey mountains as well as the Empire, a realm with whom Bretonnia has been at war with just as much as they have allied with. Due to this strategic location, Montfort Castle is one of the best human constructed fortification in the Old World. Spreading out from the massive keep are five tiers of giant sixty feet walls which have been firmly constructed into the rock itself, protecting the large town of Montfort from any hostile invaders. Naturally the Bretonnians here have decided that their hard work has earned them the right to exact heavy tolls on merchants or any other traveller that braves the dangerous but utterly important pass. Ironically and in a true Bretonnian fashion, this also includes the towns own citizens who pay much in order to gain access to the inner sections of Montfort.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_parravon;Parravon;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_parravon_desc;The impressive Bretonnian city of Parravon has been carved directly into the living rock from an outcrop of the Grey Mountains. Castle Parravon dominates the stunning city below from its high vantage point at the peak of the outcrop, tunnels stretching far down into the heart of the mountain further increasing its defensive capabilities. Parravon is also famous for its Pegasus Knights as the noble creatures themselves can be found in the nearby section of the Grey Mountains more so than anywhere else in Bretonnia.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_artois;Artois;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_artois_desc;Built in the midst of the beastmen infested Forest of Arden, Castle Artois is a well-fortified keep that has withstood its share of battles. The castle's real focus however is around providing safe accommodation for the Duke and his many mounted warriors, yeoman and knights alike, who ride out on endless hunts against the beastmen of the forest.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_gisoreux;Gisoreux;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_gisoreux_desc;The city of Gisoreux is a bustling city filled with merchants and travellers from all across the Old World with it even being said that there are more Imperial traders in Gisoreux than any other city in Bretonnia. The massive bulk of Castle Gisoreux dominates the entire city, a single curtain wall runs for well over a mile long, enclosing two large keeps that provide accommodation and protection for many of the local dignitaries.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_quenelles;Quenelles;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_quenelles_desc;Quenelles is one of the few significant inland settlements in Bretonnia. The unusual town has no eastern wall, trusting to the Fay inhabitants of the Forest of Loren to guard that flank. A steady stream of pilgrims visit in the hopes of sighting the town's guardians, though other visitors are more taken by the region's excellent wines.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_antoch;Antoch;;;;;;;;;x
ca_antoch_desc;The mighty city and fortress of Antoch was founded at the conclusion of the Crusades when the victorious Old Worlders vanquished the evil and perverted Sultan Jaffar. Disgusted at the evil that they found in Araby, the victorious knights tore down idols, burned whole libraries of dangerous books, and eventually retreated to the untainted lands of Bretonnia and the Lady of the Lake. However, some knights, driven into a frenzy of righteousness by the black-hearted evil and sickening decadence of the Arabyans, decided to remain and build a mighty fortress of virtue that would stand forever against the resurgence of darkness in the lands of Araby.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_bretonnian_knights_1_desc;It says much about a nation where the horses of its nobles live in far more luxury than most of the populace. Of course, most peasants do not have to ride to war in heavy barding or face the terrors that the Knights of the Realm do when in battle. Perhaps, therefore, if given the choice a peasant wouldn't swap his lot with that of a horse. A strange quandary, admittedly, but one that has been asked during many a tavern chatter.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_bretonnian_keep_1_desc;Bretonnian keeps are built to be bigger, sturdier and more robust than usual. Supposedly, this is so that the lords in charge of the fortresses can better aid and protect the peasants living in their land, as is their duty, but it's more commonly used to protect just the lord, and his own family and possessions, while the peasants have to fare for themselves. Typically, none of the lowborn men-at-arms and free riders are admitted inside, though Bretonnian lords commonly use the empty space to store more weapons and armor to better arm their peasants levies with.;;;;;;;;;x

In times of peace, the serfs tend to the noble's fields and the retinues keep a vigilant eye on the surronding lands, patrolling endlessly for malevolent forces. In times of war, a good many of the noble's serfs are levied into his or her's armies, and the retinues are folded into the core knightly units of the noble's army.;;;;;;;;;x

# DAWI UNIQUE BUILDINGS AND WONDERS
#
wonder_everpeak;Everpeak;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_everpeak_desc;Everpeak, Karaz-a-Karak in the language of the Dwarfs, is the ancient capital of the Dwarf empire, the "Pinnacle of Mountains", the "Most Enduring". It is the oldest and most glorious hold of the mountain folk and inside its halls is the greatest concentration of wealth in the world. Visitors have been awestruck at the magnificent beauty of the place. The most important hold politically and religiously in Dwarf culture, Karaz-a-Karak boasts of the mightiest army, greatest runesmiths and largest population out of all the Dwarf realms. It is from here that the High Kings rule and where the sacred "Great Book of Grudges" and the "Book of Remembering" are kept. It has endured countless ages against all manner of foes but it has never fallen and will endure until the end of time.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_slayer_keep;Slayer Keep;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_slayer_keep_desc;Karak Kadrin, otherwise known as "Slayer Keep", is a mighty Dwarf hold that has guarded one of the few major passes through World's Edge Mountains, the Peak Pass. For countless centuries this hold has guarded the lands of Kislev and the Empire to west against greenskin threats and worse. The hold is home to the Shrine of Grimnir and is a sacred place for all would-be Slayers. The hold also has a long history of Slayer Kings who have passed down their slayer oath through generations.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_zhufbar;Torrent Gate;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
wonder_zhufbar_desc;Zhufbar, known as the "Torrent-gate" in Khazalid, is a Dwarf hold built nestled in a deep chasm under the lake called Black Water. A huge waterfall that falls high above the city provides the necessary power for the numerous Dwarf machines that have been constructed here. The city is the principle shrine for the Engineers Guild and is a center of every kind of industry. It was here that the famed Gromril metal, which was mined from nearby Karak Varn, was smelted and forged into many famous Dwarf artifacts.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_iron_peak;Iron Peak;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_iron_peak_desc;Known as "Iron Peak", Karak Azul is built with it's upper portion on a plateau overlooking the valley below, which is unusual compared to other holds. It is also the only southern Dwarf hold that has withstood the greenskin invasions over the centuries but at great cost since today Karak Azul's population is very meagre. However, many famous rune armours and weapons were and still are being made in the hold which has contributed to the continued survival of the hold.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_vlag;Desolation Hold;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_vlag_desc;Karak Vlag is famed for iron. The hold commands enormous iron ore deposits and is home to gifted blacksmiths, weapon and armor makers, and cannonwrights. The armies of the hold put this equipment to good use securing the High Pass for Dwarfs and decent Men.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_barak_varr;Sea Gate;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_barak_varr_desc;Barak Varr, Khazalid for "Sea Gate", is a unique Dwarf hold in that it is the only Dwarf seaport in the world and houses the whole Dwarf fleet. Located at the easternmost point of the Black Gulf, the hold is built in a vast water filled cavern, carved into a cliffside which provides a natural defence for the harbour. The mighty Ironclad ships of the Dwarfs as well as numerous merchant vessels from all over the world can be found here as well, sailing in and out of the vast cavern. This hold is among the most friendly to non-Dwarfs and in turn has great revenue from trade.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_horn_hold;Horn Hold;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_horn_hold_desc;Karak Hirn, or "Horn Hold" in Khazalid, is the largest and wealthiest of the Black Mountain holds. Its name comes from the fact when wind blows in a certain direction, the large cavern within the hold creates a sound reminiscent of a mighty warhorn which is heard for miles around and which the Dwarfs have taken advantage of for many uses.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_copper_mountain;Copper Mountain;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_copper_mountain_desc;Translated as "Copper Mountain" in Khazalid, Karak Izor has the prestige of being the first and largest Dwarf hold outside the World's Edge Mountains. Located in the Vaults, it has access to the richest metal deposits, ranging from iron to copper and tin, outside the World's Edge Mountains and its influence is such that Dwarf settlements from all across the Vaults, and as far as the Apuccini Mountains, look to Karak Izor for protection and guidance. There is also a miniature version of the Underway being built deep beneath the Vaults which would allow unhindered trade between Dwarf settlements in the region.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_norn;Barren Earth Hold;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_norn_desc;Known as "Barren Earth Hold" in Khazalid, Karak Norn is the major hold in the Grey Mountains. Its population consists mainly of displaced clans from fallen holds across the Old World. While not being particularly wealthy because of the Grey Mountains' lack of large mineral deposits, Karak Norn does control the vital mountain passes in the southern Grey Mountains. It is also strategically placed on a high plateau above Loren Forest, to keep a close eye on the Wood Elves because of the long distrust the two races have for each other. Karak Norn is also on good terms with its neighbouring human realms and has helped both the Bretonnians and the Empire in the past.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karag_dum;Mount Doom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karag_dum_desc;Karag Dum is the greatest of the northern Dwarf fortresses, sunk deep into the mountain stone and guarded by warriors hardened by the constant threat of Chaos raids. For centuries the fiends of the Chaos Wastes have spent their strength on the walls of Mount Doom and had to fall back rather than pass on to attack the realms of Men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_azgal;Hoard Peak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_azgal_desc;Karak Azgal was once known as "the City of Jewels" (Karak Izril in the Khazalid tongue) and famed throughout the Eternal Realm for its wealth. But after the fall of Azril Ungol the hold was exposed to attack by the enemies of the dwarfs and was lost in turn. For a time it became the domain of the terrible dragon Graug, until the young Dwarf Skalf Drakendrengi slew the beast and liberated the hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#NORSE DWARF HOLDS
wonder_kraka_drak;Dragon Hold;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_kraka_drak_desc;Khazalid for Dragon Hold, the Norse Dwarfs of Kraka Drak have done much to earn their fearsome moniker. Said to be even more warlike than their cousins to the south, their entire society revolves around the virtue of war and the honor of battle, a necessary development given their location. This warlike demeanor has ensured their survival, however it has not been without a cost. Owing to their geographical remoteness, the foreignness of their customs, and the heterodox veneration of the ancestor gods as a collection of warrior aspects, they have become an isolated and culturally alien group to the rest of Dwarf-kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_kraka_ornsmotek;Eagle's Peak Hold;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_kraka_ornsmotek_desc;Built over the only proven gold reserves in Norsca, Kraka Ornsmotek needs every ounce of shining wealth its miners can muster. The hold lies in some of the wildest country in the region and its fierce defenders must face regular battles with giants, trolls, and the minions of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_kraka_dorden;Thunder Hold;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_kraka_dorden_desc;The Dwarfs of Kraka Dorden are known as the best hunters of their people. Furs from their prey are sold as far afield as Tilea, brought south by captains brave enough to sail the Kraken Sea and visit Thunder Hold's excellent harbour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_kraka_ravnsvake;Raven's Roost Hold;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_kraka_ravnsvake_desc;Kraka Ravnsrake is one of the only sources of Okrinaduraz in the Old World. This beautiful blue-grey stone is much prized by artisans for being both workable and durable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#LOST HOLDS
wonder_azril_ungol;Queen of the Silver Depths;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_azril_ungol_desc;Karak Eight Peaks, also known as Vala-Azril-Ungol ("Queen of the Silver Depths" in Khazalid), was one of the greatest Dwarf holds, rivaling even Karaz-a-Karak in size and power. It was located in a great bowl-shaped valley, ringed by eight high peaks. Above the surface, walls encompassed a vast area, but most of the city was built below ground. Below the earth, the city was a made up of courts and plazas with great vaulted ceilings, and further below, the tombs of the Dwarf kings and deep mines. Its fall to a combined Skaven-Night Goblin invasion meant the end of the Dwarf Golden Age. Since then, many a member of Clan Angrund has tried to reclaim their ancestral homeland from the vermin infesting it, unsuccessfully..;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_ungor;Delving Hold;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_ungor_desc;Karak Ungor guarded one of the deepest and most extensive mining complexes in the Worlds Edge Mountains. Its army fought bravely during the War of Vengeance against the Elves, but while the legions of the Stonehammer kings were marching back to their home a great earthquake struck Karak Ungor. New ways under the earth were opened up and a tide of Night Goblins poured into the great hold and swept aside its small garrison. The army of Karak Ungor tried to dislodge the invaders, but had to admit - not defeat, of course! - but that the time for reclaiming their home was yet to come.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_varn;Lake Hold;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_varn_desc;Karak Varn was once an important mining hold, but the greed of its rulers undermined its foundations - literally. By digging too deep, the dwarfs of Karak Varn opened up their home to catastrophe. An enormous earthquake cracked the stone below and let the Black Water claim the dwarf mines. Simultaneously, the enemies of the dwarfs struck, slaughtering the dazed inhabitants of the hold. Today Karak Varn is home only to monsters.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_drazh;Black Hold;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_drazh_desc;During the Dwarf Golden Age, Karak Drazh was one of the most important holds. Its vast mines made its people tremendously wealthy and well-armed. But riches and arms could not protect them from the catastrophe to come. Almost five centuries before the time of Sigmar, Karak Drazh was assaulted by an enormous greenskin horde and conquered for the children of Gork and Mork. Some few survivors escaped, leaving the hold to the rule of orcs.;;;;;;;;;x

Unlike the Tower of Gorgoth, the purpose of the Black Fortress is as a purely military outpost, and is headquarters for the Legion of Azgorh. The legion is a mighty standing army which watches over the desolated southern Dark Lands, escorts the far-flung slave caravans through the Howling Wastes and stands as a bulwark against frequent invasions of Ogres, Orcs and worse from the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_chaos_dwarf_khans_desc;The difference between a servile Hobgoblin who grew up in the slave pens of Zharr-Naggrund and a Hobgoblin warrior from the steppe is almost as great as that between a contended lapdog and a wild wolf. The Chaos Dwarfs prize the fighting spirit of the steppe Hobgoblins, hiring small groups of wolf-riders to serve as cavalry for their otherwise plodding armies. Some of these warriors return to the Steppe with their pay, others settle down to the life of an Overseer. It matters not to the Dawi Zharr, so long as there are fresh slaves tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wonder_magritta;Magritta;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_magritta_desc;Magritta is the largest and probably the most important settlement in Estalia. Located on the southern shore of the peninsula, it's one of the main trading ports of the Southern Seas. Magritta maintains a strong maritime presence here, and aggressively patrols its waters against Sartosan pirates, Arabyan corsairs and, while at it, imposes a "toll" on foreign ships moving through its territory. It is also the home of the Archecclesiatium, the main temple of the Cult of Myrmidia, and the Sacred Office of Myrmidia's Inquisition.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_bilbali;Bilbali;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_bilbali_desc;Bilbali is, in many ways, a stark contrast to its southern rival, Magritta. Where Margitta's climate is warm and bright, Bilbali is always covered in rain and fog. While Magritta's golden shores are bathed by the temperate waters of the Southern Seas, the waves of the Great Ocean clash against the rocky cliffs of Bilbali. This is noticeable even their produce, as Bilbali's main export is the weaponry in their military arsenals and gunpowder refineries. It also acts as a trading hub between Lustria and the Old World, and the city is unusually welcoming of Bretonnian merchants ( For an Estalian city, that is ).\n \nBilbali is also notable for being the home of the Tomb of Santiago de Vivar, the great Champion of Estalia who led the resistance to Arabyan invasion. Santiago is remembered for a miracle shortly after his death in which his lifeless body led a successful cavalry charge against Arabyan troops.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_cap_i_casal;Cap i Casal;;;;;;;;;
wonder_cap_i_casal_desc;The city of Campastello is totally dominated by the sprawling Cap i Casal ("Head and Home") palace complex. Unlike the southern Kings, the monarchs of Tigarre never had to abandon their ancient residence during the Arabyan invasion. Indeed, many of the beautiful works of art housed within the Cap i Casal were rushed away from the south ahead of Jaffar's armies.;;;;;;;;;
wonder_alhamra;The Alhamra Palace;;;;;;;;;
wonder_alhamra_desc;The foundations of Alhamra were built during the years of Arabyan occuption, when Sultan Jaffar believed he would need a fine residence for his new conquest. After the Reconquista, the Kings of Astarios took over the site and finished it, creating an elegant palace for their dynasty. Alhamra's fusion of Arabyan and traditional Estalian architecture symbolises the diverse character of Astarios.;;;;;;;;;
wonder_cervantes;Cervantes;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_cervantes_desc;Cervantes is an important pilgrimage site for faithful Myrmidians. The temple complex, named "Our Lady of Cervantes" was built to commemorate the appearance of the warrior-goddess to beleagured Estalian troops during the early days of the Arabyan invasion. Inspired by Myrmidia, the Estalians rallied and won an important victory that delayed the northward march of Jaffar's legions.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_estalian_barracks_1_desc;During the Arabyan wars, Estalian cavalry was routinely outclassed and driven from the battlefield by southern horsemen. Without support, Estalian infantry relied on spear and pike based tactics to defend themselves.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_estalian_barracks_4_desc;After the Reconquista, the situation for Estalia's infantrymen was reversed. Their horsemen were second to the Arabyans but tactically superior to any other cavalry in the Old World. Free from the defensive role, Estalian pikemen were massed into powerful attacking columns. Swordsmen began to shed their heavy armour and fight as "Rodeleros", skrimishers who supported the pikes.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_estalian_barracks_6_desc;The wide availability of gunpowder weapons saw the perfection of the Estalian Tercio. Armoured pikemen create a durable square, while lightly-armoured swordsmen and arquebusiers give the Tercio its teeth.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_estalian_genitores_1_desc;Arabyan cavalry humiliated Estalian knights time and time again. Even in the Reconquista, most Estalian successes were won by infantrymen and dismounted knights. Cavalrymen of more humble origin fared a little better against the invaders and were better able to adopt their tactics. When the free Estalian kingdoms emerged from occupation, they had a fine tradition of light horsemen, equally suited to battlefield harrassment and patrolling the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_estalian_genitores_4_desc;Changes in the Estalian economy have seen many knightly families lose their land and rely on their warrior skills for a livelihood. These mercenary knights - the "Caballeros" - are a common sight in Estalian armies but can sometimes be seen fighting for the lords of foreign realms. The return of heavy cavalry to Estalian armies makes them much more flexible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_estalian_militia_1_desc;The long sieges of the Arabyan war taught Estalians the value of a stout siege defence and made the crossbow the nation's favoured ranged weapon. From the battlements of a city wall, a crossbow's slow rate of fire is far less of a liability and its range is even more impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_estalian_militia_3_desc;Estalians started using firearms as early as the 15th century but lack of domestic production rendered handguns and pistols little more than a vanity piece for the gentleman soldier. Once Tilean gunsmiths finally settled in Margritta and Bilbali, the art spread throughout Estalia and even the meanest lord began to fit out his men with firearms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_estalian_militia_4_desc;The arquebus was not developed in Estalia, but its use was perfected there. The Estalian "Tercio" system perfectly combines the ranged firepower of handgunners with the strengths of the other infantry arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tb_greenskin_fort_desc;Orcs (and the goblins who do most of the work in their camps) have a very different aesthetic sense to humans.

tb_goblin_trading_post_desc;Craftier and far more cowardly than their orcish kin, goblins often enjoy taking up non-violent occupations. They are moderately successful traders, mainly making their profits by swindling and theft rather than shrewd investments. A shrewd greenskin chief sets a mob of bullies to the task of fleecing visiting goblin caravans, while making sure not to take so much that the traders avoid his settlement in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tb_goblin_mobs_desc;Goblins are perhaps the most intelligent greenskins but their brains are as often bashed out as used by their brutish Orc cousins. Were goblins anything other than craven, chittering bullies of the worst order, their suffering would perhaps be pitiable.

tb_orc_mobs_desc;It is difficult to explain the horror of the orcish race to those who have never been near these monstrous beings. The typical orc slouches but still has the height of a man, and perhaps twice his mass in dense muscle and bone. These creatures are frightfully strong, even more resilient, and with little drive to do anything but commit acts of violence. A single mob of orcs isn't much danger to a walled town, but the story is quite different when they flock together under the leadership of a powerful Warboss.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tb_goblin_cavalry_mobs_desc;The intelligence and cowardice of the goblin race actually makes them fair cavalrymen, although no horse could bear such a disgusting creature on their back.

tb_troll_scavengers_desc;Trolls are not greenskins, but these violent brutes fit into the fringes of orc and goblin camps.

tb_greenskin_waaagh_desc;The Waaagh! is a state of quasi-religious enthusiasm for destruction that periodically seizes upon greenskins, pushing their already violent temperaments to crazed extremes. Orcs and goblins in the grip of the Waaagh! will seek out a strong leader and fight boldly at his orders - but they are prone to deserting if their boss shows signs of weakness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tb_culture_black_orc_desc;Black Orcs are the result of Chaos Dwarf biomagical tampering with the orcish race. The Dawi Zharr hoped to create stronger, tougher, more disciplined slaves, and succeeded too well. The newly-created Black Orcs soon led a mighty greenskin rebellion against the Chaos Dwarfs and would have brought down the people of Hashut - were it not for the betrayal of the Hobgoblins. Black Orc mobs are not common, but wherever they are found they form the hard edge of greenskin armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tb_savage_orc_mobs_desc;Once, all orcs lived in the manner of the Savage Orcs. But contact with toher races, and especially the Chaos Dwarfs, brought new ideas and new skills. Because greenskin culture is so warlike, the ability to make metal weapons and armour made the biggest difference and most orcs have seen the advantages of this innovation. Some tribes, however, stick to the old ways, using stone and bone weapons and decorating their bodies with mystical tattoos.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tb_nasty_skulker_mobs_desc;A fair fight is the last thing a goblin wants. He'd rather get pushed around by an orc, because at least orcs are lazy and stupid enough to give up on bullying after a thump or two and perhaps a few kicks - unless they're really bored, but best not to think about that. Goblins enjoy ambushes a lot more, though many goblins just can't keep their yobs shut long enough to suprise an enemy. Nasty Skulkers, set apart from their brethren by their incredible ability to shut up, are much more dangerous. This would be better-known if Nasty Skulkers weren't so good at killing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tb_spider_cult_desc;Physically, the Forest Goblins are almost identical to their kin. However, their culture has mutated in a bizarre direction. Sharing their woodland habitat with all manner of deadly spiders has twisted the greenskins away from their traditional gods into increasingly deranged forms of spider worship. Giant spiders are treated as gods and fed members of the tribe. Tiny spiders dwell within the living bodies of Forest Goblin shamans, offering up a steady stream of hallucinogenic venom to their host. And between these extremes, pony-sized spiders are ridden as deadly mounts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tb_green_sea_mobs_desc;Orcs are surprisingly good sailors. That's not to say that they're particularly good at handling ships - the surprise is that they can sail at all! The main tactic for a cumbersome orc hulk ship is to close in, get the enemy vessel in the grip of its Iron Clawz, then let da ladz get killy!

Their bodies are so adapted to a subterranean life that the light of the sun causes them physical pain - a fact all the more astonishing because goblins generally feel very little physical discomfort. Night Goblin minds are as twisted as their bodies, warped by long exposure to bizarre fungal life and weird minerals.

ca_War_Sheep_Riders_1_desc;War Sheep are specially bred for their size, strength and pliability. Larger and more aggressive than War Sheep, Battle Rams are the Halflings heavy cavalry. They are better trained, larger and stronger. They have very thick woolly coats which makes them very hard to hurt. They also pack a powerful headbutt and have wicked horns.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_halftank_1_desc;Due to some service to the Empire(such as not going on strike for longer than a week) the Elector-Count has decided to graciously grant the Halflings the schematics to a failed version of the Steam tank, which was built too small for any Human to fit into. Turns out that it is the perfect size for a Halfling. With some proper modifications, we could use this mighty machine in our army!;;;;;;;;;x

During Pie Week, if at no other time of the year, Halflings can be said to be devout to the core of their being. Food, fire, and comfort are common offerings to Esmerelda.;;;;;;;;x

# IMPERIAL UNIQUE BUILDINGS AND WONDERS
#
wonder_altdorf;Altdorf;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_altdorf_desc; Altdorf is one of the oldest cities in the Empire, one of the and arguably its grandest, dating its foundations back to the time of Sigmar himself. Within the city's Dwarf built walls, establishments like the School of Engineers and the Cult of Sigmar conduct their day to day business protected by one of the most well equipped and trained armies in the Empire. Thanks to the city's vast wealth, it has profited from acting as one of the foremost centres of trade in the Old World.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_middenheim;Middenheim;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_middenheim_desc;Built upon a five hundred feet pinnacle of rock, Middenheim is the capital of the Imperial province of Middenland and one of the greatest fortress-cities in the realms of man, second only to Altdorf in size and influence. It is also home to the Cult of Ulric whose loyal followers would sacrifice their lives for defence of the city, the most fearsome being the legendary Knights of the White Wolf who would utterly dedicate themselves to the city's defence in a time of need.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_nuln;Nuln;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_nuln_desc;Nuln is both a spiritual and technological centre for the people of the Empire. Along with Altdorf, Nuln holds the second seat for one of the two Arch-Lectors of the Cult of Sigmar. The technological side to Nuln comes from its long and distinguished trade with the Dwarf holds, under whose expert guidance has allowed the engineers of the city to produce some of the best blackpowder weaponry in the Empire and the finest artillery crews.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_marienburg;Marienburg;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_marienburg_desc;The great city of Marienburg is the largest and most prosperous trading city in the entire Old World. Its wealth flows in from all corners of the world, no other city houses merchants from Ulthuan next door to those from far off Cathay like Marienburg. Due to this, the city enjoys a rich cultural mix which can be seen even among the local merchants who are renowned for their flamboyant ways.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_talabheim;Talabheim;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_talabheim_desc;Located in the centre of a vast crater, Talabheim is the capital of Talabecland and serves to continually watch over the darkness of the Great Forest that covers the region. The city itself struggles to cover much of the crater, allowing farms to exist with its rocky walls which ensure a steady stream of supplies during sieges, only adding to the impregnability of the city. With the rims of the crater fortified and two large fortresses placed at its only entrances, Talabheim is truly a beacon of safety for poor souls travelling along the Old Forest Road and so has allowed the city to function as the main centre of trade in the area.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_mordheim;Mordheim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_mordheim_desc;Mordheim, the City of the Damned, the former capital of the Ostermark province that was destroyed by a twin-tailed comet of Warpstone in the year 1999 IC. Once a mighty city that could rival many others within the Empire, Mordheim grew decadent with corruption, and as multitudes gathered for the arrival of the Twin-Tailed Comet, it is said that Sigmar judged them false and destroyed the city, killing all those left within. Now, it is a dead city, where only the foolish, mad or greedy seek to venture forth, either to plunder the riches of the ruins or to covet the green shards of comet-borne Warpstone that lace the entire city with its corruption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_mordheim_struck_by_comet;Mordheim was struck by a twin-tailed comet and destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_averheim;Averheim;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_averheim_desc; Lying on the banks of the river Aver, the city of Averheim is the capital of the southern region of Averland. At the centre of this prosperous city sits the impressive keep of Averburg where the Elector Count takes up residence, safe in the knowledge that it has never fallen to an invading army. The fertile region of Averland is famed for its cattle and so during the warm summers it is common to see the stockyards surrounding Averheim to be filled with cattle merchants and their livestock, sometimes even crowding the streets within the city itself, a fact which has led to Averlanders and their cattle being the joke of Imperials from other provinces.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_hergig;Hergig;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_hergig_desc; Hergig is the heavily defended capital of the sparsely populated province of Hochland. Despite being covered by both the Drakwald Forest and the equally as dangerous Forest of Shadows, Hochland has surprisingly managed to remain resilient against the constant threat of Beastmen, Forest Goblins and other dark horrors lurking in the forests. This is mainly due to its highly skilled state troops who tirelessly patrol the forest. Due to many Hochlanders being trained hunters and marksmen, their state troops contain an abundance of archers and handgunners, the best of which are armed with the highly accurate Hochland long rifle, a weapon that has earned a fearsome reputation among the Empire's foes.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_wolfenburg;Wolfenburg;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_wolfenburg_desc;The people of Ostland can best be described by the provinces symbol of the bull. Stubborn and resolute, Ostlanders are a hardy folk as one would imagine given how close they live to the Chaos realms of the north. Due to this fact of life, Ostlanders are prone to a life of almost constant drinking with some even spending most of their lives intoxicated as a way of boosting their courage to deal with the harsh world around them. The city of Wolfenburg has long been a bulwark against the threats coming from outside the Empire and from within, even if the rest of Ostland has fallen, Wolfenburg will stand strong until the end.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_stirland;Wurtbad;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_stirland_desc;Wurtbad is the capital of Stirland, a rural and poor region in the Empire. Stirland has maintained a reputation amongst other Imperials of being a rural backwater despite the many large towns that dot the countryside. Part of this is due however to the nature of Stirlanders themselves who are for the most part a conservative and superstitious folk who have remained hostile to outsiders, something which becomes understandable given their close proximity to the cursed land of Sylvania. The armies of Stirland represent the poor nature of their region with most state troops not even able to afford a proper green and yellow uniform, carrying a small token of their region instead. It would be a foolish mistake to take this poverty as a sign of weakness as soldiers from Stirland are just as devoted and brave as other Imperial soldiers.;;;;;;;;;x
drakenhof;Drakenhof Castle;;;;;;;;;x
drakenhof_desc;Castle Drakenhof is situated on the peak of high clifftop from where it casts it's dark gaze over the blighted lands of Sylvania. The citadel was cursed even before Vlad von Carstein's arrival and made it his home, an event which would further damn Sylvania in the annals of history.;;;;;;;;;x

wonder_kislev;Kislev;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
wonder_kislev_desc;The large and well developed city of Kislev is home to the Tzars of Kislev who rule over their empire from the Palace Gospodarin located in the heart of this grand city. As with the entire Empire of Kislev, the city remains under constant threat from Norscans and Chaos forces lurking to the north. Despite this constant menace, the city of Kislev has never fallen to an invading army yet, standing strong against countless sieges while the surrounding countryside burns. The Ungol and Gospodarian people who live here are a hardy folk, their horsemanship and combat skills forever tempered by raids coming down from the north which has enabled the Tzars to field one of the most fearsome mounted armies in the Old World.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_praag;Praag;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_praag_desc;The fortress city of Praag is one of the few permanent settlements of the Ungol people, serving as their de facto capital, and the northernmost bastion of civilization in the Old World. Due to the city's unfavorable position, Praag has been forced to endure near constant raids by the Chaos-worshipping Kurgans and the savage Norscans for centuries. Though the majority of these raids are a minor inconvenience dispersed by raising a pulk of horsemen from the barracks, several networks of walls have been constructed concentrically around the city kreml with far more serious threats in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_erengrad;Erengrad;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_erengrad_desc;Located where the river Lynsk meets the Sea of Claws, Erengrad is the most important trading city in the region of Kislev, and the second largest port in the north after Marienburg. Much of the city's wealth and status are a result of the lucrative trade in gems and silver with the more civilized peoples of Norsca, many of the goods eventually flowing from Erengrad to the Empire, or even further afield. Despite this enormous inflow of wealth, the city spends any spare coin constantly updating their defenses to the most modern standards, largely preventing Erengrad's burghers from spending on the frivolities that define Marienburg and the Tilea's trade cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_hexoatl_desc;Hexoatl, the City of the Sun, is the most northerly temple-city in Lustria, located on the Isthmus of Pahaux. As such, it is the first line of defence against armies invading Lustria from the north. It is the most martial temple-city, defended with high walls and surrounded by an energy shield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ca_itza_desc;Itza, the First City, is the oldest Temple-City of the Lizardmen. During the Great Catastrophe the city was ravaged by the forces of Chaos and was only saved through the sacrifice made by the Venerable Lord Kroak, the renowned Slann Mage-Priest. Summoning the Deliverance of Itza, he banished every daemon in the city, but in doing so seared all other spells from his mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ca_tlaxtlan_desc;Tlaxtlan, known as the City of the Moon, was once renowned for its astromancers and prognosticators. They observed the moon and the stars in order to make accurate predictions of future events. However with the Great Catastrophe and the appearance of the second moon in the skies above Tlaxtlan their powers waned, as the mone is comprised of pure Chaos and did not obey the laws of the universe, which governed the original moons orbit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ct_xlanhuapec_desc;Xlanhuapec, known as the City of the Mists, was the second city-temple to be built. It is perpetually shrouded in thick mist, so much so one can travel through the entirety of the city without realizing of its existance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ca_tlanqua_desc;Tlaqua has survived isolated from the inland Lizardmen outposts of the Southlands. Many generations of fierce Skink Priests strenously defended its ruined borders from the younger species during the course of the ages, successfully repelling hordes of Beastmen, Greenskins, Undead and Humans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ca_the_black_tower_desc;The Black Tower is the home of the legendary Arkhan the Black, first and foremost of all Nagash's followers. This dark tower was built by Arkhan at the height of Nagash's reign of terror and so the lands around it are saturated with dark magic, further protecting it from whomever may be foolish enough to intrude. From this tower Arkhan furthers his knowledge of dark magic,constantly seeking to improve his skill with the final goal of eventually being able to revive his dark master, Nagash.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_necropolis_of_khemri;Khemri;;;;;;;;;x
ca_necropolis_of_khemri_desc;The once great city of Khemri retains little of its former glory, the soaring towers of shining gold and the grand pyramids made of limestone and alabaster are likened to the Tomb Kings themselves,  completely rotten and fully decayed with age. The largest of the pyramids still dominate over the rest of the city thanks to the undying efforts of the Liche Priests tasked with slowly restoring the cities monuments. Nevertheless, Khemri still remains the centre of the ancient empire of Nehekhara and those who hold it even in its current state are seen as truly great leaders.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lybaras;Tomb City of Lybaras;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lybaras_desc;No different to the other cities in Nehekhara,the Tomb-City of Lybaras is an image of decayed splendour. This once glorious city is the resting place of the beautiful but formidable Queen Khalida who has dedicated the entire city to Asaph, the Nehekharan goddess of vengeance and magic who endlessly promises Khalida revenge on Nagash's vampiric spawn. The city itself is difficult for invading armies to approach, protected from the west by mountains, east by the dangerous waters of the Gulf of Fear and south by the Cursed Jungle. These natural defences have allowed Lybaras to strongly resist Khemri throughout its history.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_zandri;Zandri;;;;;;;;;x
ca_zandri_desc;The ancient city of Zandri was one of the first cities built in Nehekhara with many even claiming it to be the very first major settlement. In these times of old Zandri was the centre of a vast naval empire, fleets with ships numbering in their hundreds were stationed here and untold riches constantly flowed through the city. Although these times have long since passed, Zandri has remained an important port-city in Nehekhara and a key location that any King of Khemri would wish to control.;;;;;;;;;x

Buried by the hundreds or thousands, these subjects served their masters loyaly in life, and are now condemed to serve them forever in undeath.

Heavily armed and armored, these troops are much more threatening then the regular hosts of the Tomb Kings.;;;;;;;;x
tp_lichemortuary_1_desc;While the Liche-priests are tasked with upkeeping the undead Nehekharan servants, they also have the job of assembling the monstrous statues fielded by Tomb Kings.

What might have once been a clean, brightly colored and highly decorated wall is now covered in sand and dust, and decayed from the millenia these walls have had to endure.

tp_chaosgodstemple_1;Blasphemous Icon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_1_desc;Summoning the many minions of Chaos is a power even the lowliest servant has. Whether a Greater Daemon, a familiar, or the iron-clad warbands of the Chaos Warriors, there is always some method or ritual. For Chaos Warriors who are not led or sent by dark wings, one way is to plant a blasphemous icon in cursed ground. A sonorous call will spread, drawing Chaos Warriors and fell beasts to its source.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_2;Ruinous Altar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_2_desc;The Dark Gods' omnipresence in the reaches of the north mean men who carve out an existence there are devout indeed. To the Northmen, the favour of their Gods is a vital and glorious part of their lives. A Northman communes with his deities directly, whether upon a Ruinous Altar or not. They dedicate their body and soul to the Gods, rather than offering petty prayers at the behest of sanctimonious priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_3;Chaos Warshrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_4;Chaos Warshrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_3_desc;Prayers and sacrifices offered from Warshrines are like sweet nectar to the otherworldly beings that reside within the Realm of Chaos. The very air crackles with power around each shrine when the eyes of the Gods turn their way. The presence of altars empowers and emboldens the Chaos Warriors fighting before them, drawing only the very best into their radiance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_5;Arcane Vortex;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_5_desc;Often taking the form of a cracked ring partially buried in the ground and covered with dark runes, an arcane vortex is surely a mystery to mortals, even those not blissfully ignorant of the Dark Powers that reside in the north. What spill forth from the vortex are nightmare things and the occasional Chaos Sorcerer, sent as an emissary of the Chaos Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_6;Chaos Rift;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_6_desc;If the summoning or the glorifying act is strong enough, if the emotions of the summoner run hot and desperate, then a tear in the material realm can be made - a direct portal into the Realm of Chaos. For a mortal to stare into such a portal is to invite utter insanity, but what comes through it is the true threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_1;Palanquin of Trophies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_2;Palanquin of Trophies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_1_desc;Some roving bands of Chaos Knights will insist that their victims' skulls, bones and trinkets are collected in the aftermath of a battle. They are piled onto a palanquin by familiars and minions as testament to the Chaos Knights' abilities. Should a patron God look down and see this tribute, then he may be pleased and bless his servants with the gifts of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_3;Pillar of Skulls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_4;Pillar of Skulls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_2_desc;Pillars of skulls are not uncommon in the wastes close to the Realm of Chaos. They are said to be the bounty of the Chaos Knights, their many victims impaled on blackened lances, their souls sent to the Chaos Gods in payment for Chaos Armour and fell steeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_5;Mound of Blades;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_3_desc;In the tribal warbands of Chaos Warriors, customs and traditions are few and far between. Yet, one practice does seem appear to take place. To take a weapon from the mound of blades a Chaos Warrior must first place another upon it. The offered weapon cannot be his own, it must be taken from the corpse of a sworn foe. The rare few who forswear this custom discover at their cost that this is one tradition that the Chaos Gods seem to appreciate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_6;Reliquary of Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_4_desc;Reliquaries are unholy stores of a Warband's most treasured weapons. It is true that champions keep their most prized accoutrements on their person at all times, but for those lucky enough to acquire a fine blade or ensorcelled axe, a reliquary will keep it safe from rivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tb_steppe_hold_1;Tribal Gathering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steppe_hold_1_desc;Although not tribes in the same sense as the Northmen, Chaos Warriors band together according to affiliations in their previous lives and, of course, their patron deities. Even those Warriors that worship Chaos undivided still have their own tribal connections, so band together to await the rise of Great Champion - a King with three eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steppe_hold_2;Fortified Encampment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steppe_hold_2_desc;The Warriors of Chaos have no need of food and sleep, for they are imbued with power from the Chaos Gods and sustenance is a mortal concern. The iron-bound men make camp together to form bonds, warbands and worship their fell, Ruinous masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steppe_hold_3;Unholy Legion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steppe_hold_3_desc;Due to the nature of the Chaos Wastes, tribes must be mobile in order to avoid being swallowed whole by the unpredictable threats that sometimes tear into reality. Simple yet effective, these yurts are where the rulers of the north dwell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tb_mabuya_desc;When the Jade first arrived on the Dragon Isles, they used their gaze to brainwash almost all of the local Lizardmen, turning them into obedient slaves. Yet, the Old Ones provided for their children and one of their Spawning Pools gave birth to a wise and powerful Skink Priest who resisted the Jade and freed some of their siblings. Mabuya is the last independent outpost of the Lost Lizardmen, desperately trying to survive the vampiric invasion from the east.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_buccaneers_1_desc;Buccaneers are the Sartosan-Tilean equivalent of lower nobility, having made names for themselves on the high seas, and having access not only to better weapons and armor, but also to the Pirate Lord or Lady's ear.

ca_piratecav_1_desc;Most pirate combatants will fight on foot, as horses are difficult to keep on ships and are a rare privilege for most lords and ladies armies. Those that do field these cavalry units often find that they make great land raiders, easily striking at villages and vanishing before the local forces can organize against the raid.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_piratecav_2_desc;While the Sartosan-Tileans and Sartosan-Norscans do not field large amounts of cavalry, nor having a standing tradition for horseback fighting, the Arabyans field some of the finest cavalry units the world has seen.

tr_whaling_village_1_desc;Norscan Whalers are not just typical hunters, they are also well-abled warriors. Since whaling is an important trade for Norsca, Whalers are respected even among the warriors due to the extreme dangers of the waters surronding Norsca. Swimming through the dark currents of the Sea of Claws are massive whales, many of which bear strange markings, and odd colouration, twisted and warped as they are by the power of Chaos. These monsters can capsize ships and swallow hundreds of men in a single gulp. Thus, Whalers must be made of sterner stuff than ordinary fishermen;;;;;;;;;x

wonder_luccini;The Acropolis of Luccini;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_luccini_desc;Luccini is the great city of Southern Tilea. According to legend, it was founded by the twins Lucan and Luccina and predates even Remas. (Serious scholars have yet to verify this boast.) Today, mighty armies of pikemen march under the Leopard banner of Luccini's princes and merchants flock to the city's markets. The city is also a religious center, with many temples standing atop the Acropolis at the city's heart. The greatest of Luccini's temples is the Theatre of Ravens, the domed heart of Morr's grim faith.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_miragliano;Miragliano;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_miragliano_desc;One of the mightiest city-states of Tilea, Miragliano is constnatly assailed by the plagues and insidious ratmen coming from the Blighted Marshes to its west. In order to survive, the city has become highly fortified, especially in the years following the terrible Red Pox of 1812.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_monte_castello;Monte Castello;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_monte_castello_desc;Built on the ruins of an ancient Elven citadel, strengthened by Dwarf masons, and manned by some of the toughest mercenaries in the Old World: Monte Castello is the most formidable fortress in Tilea.;;;;;;;;;x

wonder_pavona_desc;Small but elegant, Pavona is famous for the many bridges which allow its privileged upper class to spend their lives literally above the common masses.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_remas;Remas;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_remas_desc;If you ask one of the locals, Remas is the greatest and most ancient city in Tilea. That might not be entirely true, but it is an impressive place by anyone's account. Remas is home to a huge circular port, said to have been built when the city was still a High Elf trading post. Even in its dilapidated state, the port still houses a powerful fleet and bustles with commerce. The port is linked to the city herself by an enormous bridge, on which many businesses and fine palaces stand. Remas proper is laid out on a grand scale within a long circuit of defenses, and her citizens are rightly proud of their skill as pikemen.\n \nPerhaps even more striking than the city is the city within, the gigantic walled temple-fortress known as the Mount of Myrmidia. This state-within-a-state has its own guards, an army of templar knights, and vast political influence.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_tobaro;Tobaro;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_tobaro_desc;Lying on a narrow plain between the Siren Sea and the Abasko Mountains, the city of Tobaro has a history of just hanging on. It saw off siege by the Arabyan armies of Jaffar, navigated intrigues by Crusaders who sought to convert the city into an enormous chapter-house, fought back the scurrying rat-men, and even elected a pig as Prince of the City. Tobaro can survive anything.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_trantio;Trantio;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_trantio_desc;Trantio is a relative newcomer to the games of the Tilean Princes. For centuries it was a backwater, isolated from the main trade routes and only able to secure its independence from Remas and Miragliano by masterfully playing one off against the other. In more recent times the explorer Marco Colombo installed himself as Prince and wisely invested Lustrian treasure in the city.\n \nWhat next for Trantio?;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_verezzo;The Towers of Verezzo;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_verezzo_desc;Many prosperous cities outgrow their walls. In Verezzo's case, the solution has been to build up, rather than out, creating the tallest city in the realms of men. The towers of the Verezzan elite can be seen from miles around. Architects and engineers rarely want for work in this inventive city.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_tilean_ranged_barracks_1_desc;Even after the old Dwarf Empire collapsed, Tilea's geography sheltered her people from Greenskin invasion for many centuries. Unlike the other human nations of the Old World, they had the time to develop their culture and craftsmanship before facing the Orcs and Goblins. So, when the WAAAGH! finally came across the Apucini Mountains, it broke on stout city walls and deadly crossbow bolts.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tilean_ranged_barracks_2_desc;The handgun's tale in Tilea is a strange one. It arrived in the country fairly early, at first traded by Dwarfs and then manufactured by Tileans as early as the 19th century. However, Tilean pride in their superb crossbows made the country reluctant to take up gunpowder weapons. It took generations of careful craft before handgun workshops could really be considered artisans turning out quality weapons of war.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tilean_ranged_barracks_3_desc;Clumsy handguns were always a marginal concern in Tilea. But the arquebus? That weapon could catch the imagination of Tilean Princes and generals alike. Small gunsmith concerns rapidly expanded and the white cloud of gunpowder smoke became the tell-tale sign of a Tilean force on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_tilean_pike_barracks_2_desc;Tilean tactics evolved to make the Pikemen - the "Picchieri" - the primary fighting arm. Shield-bearers were phased out in favor of longer pikes and heavier armour. The vulnerable flanks of deep pike formations were trusted to crossbowmen and handguners.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_tilean_monte_castello_troops_desc;Monte Castello guards the coastal route from the Borderlands into Tilea. While orcish raids over the Apucinni Mountains are a constant nuisance, any serious invasion would have to take the southern route. For this reason, the Merchant-Princes of Tilea managed to cooperate and build Monte Castello as one of the finest fortresses in the Old World, and agree to collectively fund its garrison. Despite many determined sieges, the fortress has never fallen.\n\nCynical observers point to Monte Castello as a symbol of Tilea's wasted potential. If the city-states can accomplish so much the one time they worked together, think how much Tilea could have achieved as a nation-state!;;;;;;;;;x

By 1100 IC, there was a thriving client kingdom of Luccini known as "Aegos". However, the greenskin menace reared its head again and Aegos was broken apart by raids and invasions. The people of the successor principalities, still as independent-minded as any Tilean, blame their homeland for this disaster and in times of trouble they rely on their "Stradiot" cavalrymen rather than aid from the Merchant Princes.;;;;;;;;;x

tb_cragfort_4;Desolate Fortress;;;;;;;;;x
tb_cragfort_1_desc;The Fimir are an ancient race of Cyclops-like, half-daemonic monsters that inhabit the marshes and bogs of the old world. Long ago, these twisted and evil creatures were the chosen servants of the Dark Gods, but when the first of Mankind arrived, the Fimir lost the favor of their patrons, and their dark empire fell. Now, most live in Ruined, Desolate fortresses and castles deep in the bogs and marshes of the old world.;;;;;;;;;x

tb_shearllevy_4;Shearl Pens;;;;;;;;;x
tb_shearllevy_1_desc;The Shearl are the lowest in the Fimir caste system, being the 'drones' of the race. They are a stupid, slow-witted bunch, and are mostly used as chaff for the nobles and warriors.;;;;;;;;;x

tb_fimmwarriors_1_desc;The Fimm are the second highest class in the Fimir caste system, being the warriors and nobles of the race. While they are about as intelligent as an Ork, they have the same brutish strength and behaviour, easily overpowering a man.;;;;;;;;;x

tb_dirachlair_3;Dirach Lair;;;;;;;;;x
tb_dirachlair_4;Dirach Lair;;;;;;;;;x
tb_dirachlair_1_desc;The Dirach are the third highest class of the Fimir caste system, being the wizards and priests of the race. Much like the Meargh, they are highly intelligent, and the Dirach are capable of controlling and binding Daemons to their services, such as Nuckelavees. While not as powerful as a trained Human wizard, Dirach are still very deadly, and can demolish scores of soldiers in seconds.;;;;;;;;;x

tb_ruinedarmory_1_desc;While the Shearl do not wear armor into battle, the Fimm, Dirach, and Meargh do wear rudimenary armor and have some quality weapons to use, but most of these arms and wears come from the long abandon stocks of their home, left when the previous inhabitants either died or abandon the fortress.;;;;;;;;;x

tb_quittax;Qu'ittax;;;;;;;;;x
tb_quittax_desc;Qu'ittax is the largest Miyan-inhabited ruin in Lustria, and used to be an important city-temple of the Lizardmen. A great pit full of teeth and jagged rocks lies at it's center, where the Miyan perform bloody rituals to honour their ravenous god, Kukaili.;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ganaina;Ganaina;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ganaina_desc;Ganaina is the largest Amazon stronghold in Lustria, and the most important religious center as well. The core of this settlement is a collection of ancient pyramids and towers built by the Old Ones. This complex extends deep into the earth, creating a labyrinth of linked underground vaults full of the wonders left by their creators. The two largest pyramids looming over the settlement are the Queen's Palace and the Temple of Rigg. The Temple of Rigg is the heart of the Amazon faith, and the center of their teaching and instruction.;;;;;;;;;x

tb_culture_miyan_1_desc;Miyan blowdart warriors are mustered here. Blowdarts are simple tools, but these barbaric halflings have been able to perfect its uses into an art-form, with weekly competitions, with the winner usually getting to eat a prisoner after all is said and done. They wear mostly padded armor, but also wear striking masks to frighten their enemies and bring them luck on the battlefield. Their darts are tipped with poison from the most poisonous plants and frogs in the area, and it is considered a great honor to not only catch the frogs and tip darts in their poison, but also eat them...;;;;;;;;;x

ca_sudenburg;Sudenburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ca_sudenburg_desc;Sudenburg is one of the richest merchant cities of the Southlands and the only colony of Old Worlders that survived the backlash of the Bretonnian Crusades. Once a cosmopolitan meeting point of the different Arabyan, Southlander and Westerlander cultures, it has turned into a full Sigmarite city after the machinations of the Mahtmasi nearly caused its destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tp_witchhunter_samur;Witch Hunter Chapter;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tp_witchhunter_samur_desc;The Graf of Sudenburg granted the temple of Samur to the Knight-Captain who saved his city from the Mahtmasi's spells and prevented a war against the city-states of Olohrad and Al-Anaim in the XIX century. Since then, the Witch Hunters have been a constant presence in Sudenburg, keeping in check the influence of the undead lurking in the swamps around it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# DUMP BUILDINGS
#
#ca_al_haikk_desc;Al-Haikk is traditionally the capital of Araby, whenever the nation is united. Once known as the ?Jewel of Araby?, the city has declined importance in recent years, with continued wars, disasters and sieges targeting it due its source of legitimacy as the seat of the Great Sultan of All-Araby. While it?s usually called the ?City of Thieves? nowadays, due to the rampant depopulation ? and thievery ? in some of its old quarters, and overshadowed by other thriving rival cities, it remains a prestigious location to all Arabyans.;;;;;;;;;x
#tp_chaos_dwarf_ziggurat_walls_1_desc;The thick outer walls of a Chaos Dwarf Ziggurat are made out of the same dark obsidian as the rest of the structure. While common obsidian is known to be brittle, the Dawi Zharr have perfected their obsidian bricks into a strong material, thanks to their magical skill, alchemy and other darker, sorcerous secrets. As such, these towering walls strike an imposing visage amongst the enemies ? and slaves ? of the Chaos Dwarfs.;;;;;;;;;x
#ca_impcastle_1_desc;While most Human architecture cannot compete with those of the elder races, the Imperials can say with pride that theirs are fairly close to dwarf stock. Elegant, yet intimidating, Imperial castles are normally situated on points of strategic importance, such as river forks or high Plateaus. Like Tilean palaces of the south, Imperial castles have a small cadre of artists, scientists, and engineers to upkeep the castle.;;;;;;;;;x
#ca_imptown_1_desc;Like their Bretonnian counterparts, Imperial castles will normally have villages and hamlets outside their walls, for the castle can provide some safety to the villagers below. Unlike their Bretonnian counterparts, however, is that these villagers can move around freely, stimulating trade and spreading new ideas throughout the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x
#ca_nuln_artillery_foundry_desc;The grand city of Nuln is the centre of production for blackpowder weapons and accessories in the Empire with even many dwarfs taking up residence here to lend a hand in both producing and designing many of these weapons.;;;;;;;;;x

#ct_druchiimarketplace_1_desc;The great slave markets of the Druchii are places of pain and depravity, where the master's leash cuts deep and the very air thick with malice. Here, slaves are corraled into various stocks and pens, awaiting their fates, weither it be to die toiling in mines, dying in battle, or worse yet, becoming another plaything for their new Druchii masters.;;;;;;;;;x
#tr_alddrakkbar_1_desc;The Ald-Drakk-Bar are a series of ancient fortifications locaed in the Norscan mountains. Likely built by the original Dwarf settlers when they first arrived in Norsca, these gates protect choke-points and important holds from harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ca_norscan_stables_1_desc;Norscans are not known to field cavalry, instead relying upon mercenaries from their more northerly brethren to fill the gaps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ca_tilean_keep_1_desc;The main keeps of Tilean fortresses are usually ostentatious palaces built by its myriad of Princes. While they lack the typical garrison of armoured footmen and free riders of other realms, they make up with a veritable army of philosophers, painters, sculptors and other polymaths seeking patronage, who make the abodes of Tliean princes into true cultural ? and financial - centers.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_halfling_barracks_1;Halfling Barracks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_halfling_great_1;Great Militia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_halfling_great_1_desc;Rather than forcing Halflings into long, brunchless days of training, it is possible to simply drag as many as possible from their homes at the time of crisis. The effect of a great many angry, hungry Halflings defending their dinners are not to be underestimated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tp_hotpot_3;Hot-Pie Catapult;;;;;;;;;x
tp_hotpot_4;Hot-Pie Catapult;;;;;;;;;x
tp_hotpot_5;Hot-Pie Catapult;;;;;;;;;x
tp_hotpot_1_desc;The Hot-Pie Catapult is an intersting Halfling invention, made out of desperation by a Halfling cook when he came under attack by a Goblin force. He would eventually win the battle, in thanks to his makeshift artillery units that fired incredibly hot pies at the goblins, which proved to be surprisingly effective against them. Ever since the battle, the temples and shrines to Esmeralda always have a small number of these catapults, in case they come under attack.;;;;;;;;;x
