EVTDESC_COM_3;We would be honored if you where to join [GetCollegeCharacterIsPartOf], of course some testing will needed to see if you have the aptitude to be a productive member.\nSigned,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_COM_3;I would love to join.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_COM_3;On second thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_COM_3;You've tried your best to follow the tests and exercises given to you since you arrived, but it's clear from the mages testing expressions at the end of the day that you have zero ability to grasp the winds of magic. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_COM_3;You've tried your best to follow the tests and exercises given to you since you arrived, you almost think you have failed but to your surprise you are informed you have some ability to call the Winds of Magic. Though you are cautioned that you will struggle to progress past basic spellcasting they will still grant you entrance to the college.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_COM_3;You've tried your best to follow the tests and exercises given to you since you arrived, it’s hard work but you are informed you have a fairly standard ability to call the Winds of Magic. Shortly after you are granted entrance to the college.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_COM_3;You've tried your best to follow the tests and exercises given to you since you arrived, it’s surprisingly easy work but and you are not surprised when you are informed you have a natural ability to call the Winds of Magic. Shortly after you are granted entrance to the college.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_COM_3;You've barely had to try on the tests and exercises given to you since you arrived, barely half the day is over before your examiners excuse themselves and quickly return almost falling over themselves offering you membership. It seems you are viewed as something of a prodigy with magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_COM_4;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_COM_4;Damn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOM100;"You overreach your ability [Root.GetSocietyRank]. Are you saying you want to challange me for leadership of the [GetCollegeOrderCharacterIsPartOf]?" [combatant_2.GetSocietyRank] [combatant_2.GetFirstName] rises from [combatant_2.GetHerHis] behind his desk, "Perhaps we should settle this in the dueling room?".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOM102;As the duel begins, [other_combatant.GetTitledName] comes at me slowly, probing my defences with spells. I offer [other_combatant.GetHerHim] my best taunting smile, and it does not take long before I have managed to overwhealm their magical defences and see them thrown to the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOM103;[combatant_2.GetSocietyRank] [other_combatant.GetFirstName] has an air of unquestioned confidence about [other_combatant.GetHerHim]. Despite all my spellcasting ability [other_combatant.GetSheHe] simply deflects everything I throw at them. At the end of it all, I am lying on the ground humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOM200A;In a surprise announcement [From.GetTitledName] has declared sweeping changes the Empires laws governing magic, these laws will establish 8 orders of magic under the direct authority of the [From.GetTitle]. The duty of these orders will be to advance mankind’s understandings of the Arcane and provide Battle Mages to the Imperial army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOM200B;In a surprise announcement [From.GetTitledName] has declared sweeping changes to the laws governing magic in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], these laws will establish 8 orders of magic under the direct authority of the [From.GetTitle]. The duty of these orders will be to advance mankind’s understandings of the Arcane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_COM_304;It appears the [GetCollegeOrderCharacterIsPartOf] has fallen on hard times with no [GetCollegeOrderRankIsPartOf]'s capable of taking on students, meaning you will need to master it yourself, while learning will be harder this lack of competition provides a unique opportunity to progress up the ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_COM_304;As part of your introduction to the [GetCollegeOrderCharacterIsPartOf] you have been introduced to [potential_teacher.GetSocietyRank] [potential_teacher.GetFirstName] who will be serving as your main teacher for the next few years of study. Hopefully this is the start of a fruitful relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_COM_304;Sadly your previous teacher will no longer be able to complete your training.

EVTDESC_COM_305;As part of your duties for the [GetCollegeCharacterIsPartOf] you are required to take a mentoring role for students in the [GetCollegeOrderCharacterIsPartOf], you have just been introduced to one of the newest students [From.GetTitledName] who has been assigned to you, hopefully they will not prove to be a waste of your time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_COM_305;Listen well and you will go far in the [GetCollegeOrderCharacterIsPartOf];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_COM_400;I have been with the [GetCollegeCharacterIsPartOf] for some time however it is clear that to advance one must make a name for themselves, either though making powerful allies, deeds in battle or in bold new discoveries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
