ice_witch_sisterhood;Ice Witch Sisterhood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ice_witch_sisterhood_desc;Formed over a thousand years ago by the Khan-Queens, the Ice Witches have manoeuvered their way into influencing almost all matters in Kislev. They strive to ensure almost nothing is beyond their reach. They suppress competing philosophies and magic and promote those sympathetic to their causes. Even the cults have been carefully monitored and guided through the centuries. The Witches are keen to ensure no Kislevite religion ever gains the same all-encompassing power seen in other Old World nations, as such supremacy often heralds the suppression of their kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_QUEEN_0;This blade has been passed down through the ages from Tzarina to Tzarina, Mother to daughter, since Miska gave it to her daughter Shoika. In keeping with this time honored tradition, the blade is now yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_QUEEN_0;May my enemies fall as did Miska's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# THE ERENGRAD REPUBLIC
#
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_0;Rebellious Erengrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_0;The important trade city of Erengrad rebelled against their suzerain ruler in Kislev durning the civil war during the succession crisis several decades ago. While they have made no claims of being above the [Root.GetTitle], they have set a dangerous precedent for other would-be secessionists. Their continued refusal to submit willingly has only served to inflame tensions.\n\nWhile we are justified in launching a punitive expidition, the burghers may yet convince us to accept their pretense of self-rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_0;The rebellious burghers have defied my will for too long!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ERENGRAD_0;Their coin could make a very convincing argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# WHAT TO DO WITH THE VECHE
#
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_1;Fate of the Erengrad Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_1;The center of Republican rule in Erengrad has long been its Veche, the seat of their burgher republic. As a powerful symbol of their popular rule, and the administrative heart of their republic, destroying it will break their will and discourage any further discussion of self-rule. However, allowing them to retain it will be seen as a gesture of the [Root.GetTitle]'s mercy, and will do much to cement their loyalty to the [Root.GetTitle] in Kislev.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_1;The Veche burns. Their defiance cannot go unpunished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ERENGRAD_1;The Veche shall remain at the pleasure of the [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# THE TZAR/TZARINA DEMANDS A BRIBE
#
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_2;The Kislevite Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_2;The ignoble sovereign in Kislev has given us the option to pay a bribe or risk their might. While there is reason to believe that such threats are baseless posturing, a refusal still risks the independence of our Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_2;Our continued independence is worth a few coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ERENGRAD_2;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# BRIBE RECIEVED
#
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_3;Threats Pay Off;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_3;The burghers of Erengrad have agreed to pay us a hefty sum to ensure that they remain independent. While they are certainly not happy about being forced to part with any coin, our threat of our invasion no longer stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_3;I made them an offer they couldn't refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# THREATS REBUFFED
#
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_4;Erengrad Unmoved;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_4;The arrogant burghers of Erengrad have foolishly denied your just demand. In response to your most humble request, the patricians of the city have replied only with insults and affronts to your dignity as their rightful suzerain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_4;Their folly will soon be made clear to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# KISLEVITE MELTING POT

U_EVTDESC55003;Gospodars, Ungols and other people of Kislev once divided are now creating family bonds and adopting new identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTDESC55004;More and more people in Kislev are adopting new identity. Some of courtiers also embraced new ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTDESC55005;Whole realm has adopted new Kislevarin. My servants inform me that it is increasingly popular to show new customs and speak new Kislevarin amongst Ungol and Gospodar Boyars and Szlachta...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTDESC55006;My wise liege has persuaded me to adopt new customs and new identity - I am not Gospodar or Ungol now I've become Kislevite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# KISLEVITE

EVTDESC_KISLEV_1;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has requested to join the Gryphon Legion in their struggle against enemies of Kislev. Gryphon Legion is an elite winged lancers company. They fight as mercenaries in whole Old World, still they are fiercly loyal to Kislev and always defend it when situation demands it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# AFTER BIRTH CEREMONY DAZH GRANTS PROTECTION
#
EVTDESC_KISLEV_5;In Kislev every newborn infant is to be commended to the protection of Dazh. It is expected of you to follow the ancient tradition, prepare the ceremonical fire and invite most important memebers of the holding to the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KISLEV_5;Tradition is everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KISLEV_5;Nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESCA_KISLEV_6;Guest have gathered and ceremony started. Together with child's mother you pass baby through the flames of ceremonial fire symbolically burning away any bad luck or Chaos taint... as you do it baby starts crying - a sign of a good luck! Dazh has granted your child his protection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_KISLEV_6;The ceremony starts and whole court has gathered witness it. Together with child's mother you pass baby through the flames of fire symbolically burning away any bad luck or Chaos taint... as you do it the mother notices that baby is noticeably burned! Bad luck! Dazh refused to granted your [From.GetBestName] his protection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#
EVTDESCA_KISLEV_8;Living so far north brings the danger of Chaos corruption. Among Ungols it is the Wise Woman whp guard tribe against taint and dispose of those touched by Chaos. A Wise woman of your tribe came to see your child. During ceremony she will check if newborn is free from influence of Chaos...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KISLEV_8;Let spirits be merciful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESCA_KISLEV_9;Hag declared that child carries chaos taint and has to be removed from Stanitsa. In northern regions the Chaos threat is all to real and no one dares to oppose the Wise Women. It is last time you see your baby [chaos_tainted.GetBestName], Hag will take it and now there's nothing to do but mourn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_KISLEV_9;Gods be praised! A stanitsa Hag found not taint in your child! Yet, before leaving she marked your baby with Curse: [chaos_tainted.GetHagsCurse];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KISLEV_9;Gods why!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Wardrobe
#
EVTDESCwardrobe.0;You've grown restless these past few weeks and once again find yourself unable to sleep, pacing in circles about your room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_0;Perhaps I should explore the castle a little?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.1;You begin to wander the twisting halls of the castle, exploring the occasional room, finding little of note. But in one room you notice a large wardrobe hidden in the shadows, strangely you cant help but feel a sense of malice eminating from the thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_1A;Its getting late... I should get back to my room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_1B;Where did this come from?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.11;Without taking your eyes off the wardrobe you back out of the room, only after its out of sight do you turn around and sprint back to your quarters. Slamming the door behind you and leaping into your bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_11;Close your eyes and get some sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.12;You move cautiously closer to the wardrobe to investigate, it resonates with an icy chill and elaborate motifs of snowy forests and frozen rivers are carved into the wood and iron. Its truly beautiful, you feel as if you cant look away and reach a hand out to touch it, before you realize what you've done you've opened the door and crawled inside the door shutting itself firmly behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_12;How deep is this thing?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.2;Suddenly, you stumble out of the back of the wardrobe, the first thing you notice isn't the trees, or the freshly fallen snow its the biting unbearable cold. Your teeth chatter as you bundle yourself in some old furs from the wardrobe and head down a nearby path. Its not long before you come upon a fork... Which way now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_2A;Take the left fork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_2B;Take the right fork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.21;After wandering down the path for what seems like hours, your fingers and toes begin to feel numb from the cold and you begin to think longingly of the warm bed waiting in your quarters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_21;I've been here far too long, time to get home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.3;After wandering down the path for several minutes you stumble into a small clearing densly packed with ruined buildings clustered around a small well, as you wander towards the center of what you presume is an abandoned town you feel an ominous presence directly around the next corner, an overwhelming sense of dread fills your very bones as you catch a glimpse of a terrible beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_3A;Make a run for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_3B;Hide! Quick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.31;Without a moments hesitation you turn around and sprint in the direction of the wardrobe. When your just a few feet away you glance back but whatever it was chose not to follow you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_31;Quickly climb back inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPwardrobe.31;making it back safely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.32;The beast notices you immediately and sinks a serrated claw into your thigh as you try to escape, dragging you towards its jagged maw. You managed to kick free of the beast and struggle to your feet, adrenaline fills your veins as you stumble to the wardrobe and crawl inside thankful that thing didn't chase after you. You emerge and collapse to the floor covered in blood, the wardrobe slowly merges with the wall behind you as you call out for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_32;Help! I'm hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPwardrobe.32;it seeing you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.33;Without thinking you duck into the nearest doorway and crawl under the remains of what appears to be a bed, after waiting for what felt like hours without making a sound you feel the presence recede and cautiously crawl from your hiding place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_33;Take a look around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPwardrobe.33;going unnoticed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.4;Though the room is dark and covered in decay you know something terrible happened here, you head towards the doorway to leave, before you do you notice a faint purple glow coming from a large gemstone built into the mantle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_4A;Whats this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPwardrobe.4A;Reach out and touch the gemstone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_4B;Leave it where it is and get out of here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.41;As you lay your hand upon the stone it flashes with a blinding purple light and you feel a strange power surge through you! You can't help but exclaim loudly in surprise and elation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_41;Head back to the wardrobe, that thing might have heard you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.5;As you emerge from the hulking wardrobe your struck by a strong nausea and collapse as the room spins around you. It takes several moments to regain your senses, the wardrobe is gone and the sun is shining through the nearby window..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_5;Was it all a dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
