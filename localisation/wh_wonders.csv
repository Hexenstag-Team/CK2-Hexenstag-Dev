upgrade_opera_house;Opera House;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_opera_house_desc;The Opera was the first form of music to be performed for the public in specialized musical theatres.

# ENGINEERING #
upgrade_engineered_canals;Engineered Canals;;;;;;;;;;;;x

upgrade_great_keep;Great Keep;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_great_keep_desc;Developments in artillery and battle magic are reducing the usefulness of high stone fortifications, but a stout keep still serves as a base of operations for a city's defenders.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_great_walls;Great Walls;;;;;;;;;;;;x

upgrade_temple_quarter;Temple Quarter;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_temple_quarter_desc;The gods of the Old World are not jealous. Most of their worshippers will pray to many gods in the course of a single day, invoking the power of whichever deity seems right for the moment. It is common for the temples of a great city to cluster together for convenience, though priesthoods with conflicting political interests are usually buffered by their more amicable peers.\n§GBuilding this upgrade will unlock new options.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_templar_orders;Templar Orders;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_templar_orders_desc;The Gods of the Old World inspire fierce loyalty among their followers and there's never a shortage of warriors ready to defend their temples.

upgrade_great_shallya_temple_desc;Despite the grandeur of other faiths, Shallya is the universal goddess of the Old World. Her priests are numerous and widely-admired and her shrines attract a steady stream of generous donations.

upgrade_great_taal_rhya_temple;Great Temple of Taal and Rhya;;;;;;;;;;;;x

upgrade_great_ulric_temple;Great Temple of Ulric;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#
# GREENSKIN ADAPTATIONS #
#
upgrade_cave_squigs;Cave Squig Farm;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_cave_squigs_desc;Greenskin biology is strange and inexplicable. Squig biology is outright bizarre. These weird spherical creatures are almost all fanged mouth and savage disposition. They come in all manner of sizes, ranging up to monsters bigger than a Bilbali Pazo. Most greenskins eat a great deal of squig flesh, but they also chain these beasts to be used in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_goblin_jester;Goblin Jester;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_goblin_jester_desc;Most goblins are chattering, annoying creatures. Goblin Jesters take these traits beyond excess. These insufferable prats naturally rare and rarely survive more than a month at the side of a warboss before having their necks broken. Among greenskins, being able to maintain a steady stream of replacement Jesters is a sign of great prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_greenskin_fighting_pits;Fighting Pits;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_greenskin_fighting_pits_desc;Greenskins naturally take out their aggressions on one another, but a warboss who really wants to toughen up da ladz will have a gladiatorial setup to thin out the weakest boyz and help their stronger brethren grow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_greenskin_fungal_forest;Fungal Forest;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_greenskin_fungal_forest_desc;The Old World is home to all manner of fungi and slimes, some of which can grow to prodigious size.

upgrade_greenskin_kunnin_traps;Kunnin' Traps;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_greenskin_kunnin_traps_desc;When greenskins take over a dwarf hold, it's common for the goblins among them to design fiendish traps to "improve" the defences. While these devices certainly make the hold more dangerous for potential attackers, they also take their toll on the new inhabitants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_orc_brute_mobs;Orc Brute Mobs;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_orc_brute_mobs_desc;Contrary to popular opinion, orcs also have their thinkers and their doers. The kunnin' warboss might not be eloquent, but he is a thinker. The Orc Brute is on the other end of the scale, massive and powerful but content to bash whoever he is told to bash without getting caught up in trying to be too clever.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_river_troll_colony;River Troll Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_river_troll_colony_desc;Wetlands are a particularly favourable environment for trolls, full of game and free from the civlized races which attempt to control troll populations. Worse yet, "River Trolls" adapted to amphibious life have an eye-wateringly foul stench and a thick couting of protective slime, making them even more dangerous foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_river_troll_hag_coven;River Troll Hag Coven;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_river_troll_hag_coven_desc;Almost every troll is too stupid to work magic. But hag who live long enough and grow big enough soak up the foul energies of death and can wield them powerfully - if clumsily.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_rock_troll_colony;Stone Troll Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_rock_troll_colony_desc;It is not known whether Stone Trolls are a distinct subspecies of their breed or merely ordinary trolls who have spent long periods of time subsisting on a mineral diet. Regardless, these creatures have all the strength, stupidity, and regenerative ability of normal trolls, combined with a rocky hide that makes them even more resilient.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_squigball_arena;Squigball Arena;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_squigball_arena_desc;Squigball!!! This vicious team sport is one step removed from a gang brawl, but it does a fine job of channeling greenskin aggression into a (usually) non-murderous direction. This is very good news for the tribe's smaller members.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_totem_gork;Totem of Gork;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_totem_gork_desc;This crude totem has been thrown together in honor of the greenskin god of brutal cunning, Gork. Or perhaps it's to Mork?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

upgrade_totem_mork_desc;This crude totem has been thrown together in honor of the greenskin god of cunning brutality, Mork. Or perhaps it's to Gork?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_warboss_hall;Warboss Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_warboss_hall_desc;Most of the time, a Warboss shows his status with his physical stature, some personal decoration, and by bashin' whoever gets in his way. But successful warbosses do fit out crude audience chambers with their grotesque trophies and some grow to enjoy lording their status over lesser beings. When the tribe has captured a great holding of some more sophisitcated race, any manner of building might end up converted into a really grand throne room.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_warchanter_grotto;Warchanter Grotto;;;;;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_warchanter_grotto_desc;There are no priests of Mork and Gork, but Warchanters come close. These greenskins can hear the primal rhythm of the Waaagh! and drum them out to stir up the reast of the boyz.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
