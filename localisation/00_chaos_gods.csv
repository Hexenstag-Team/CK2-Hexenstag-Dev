# THE FATHER OF MYSTERIES
#
fickletzeentch;The world seems so vast and confusing to you, there is so much left to understand, but the idea of trying to grasp something so complex makes you sink into a pit of hopelessness. The one day, the great Architect of Fate taps into your addled brain, giving you brief glimpses of inspiration and clarity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TestofTzeentch9A;I will carefully study these visions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TestofTzeentch9B;I would risk everything, to know the infinite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TestofTzeentch9C;I fear the power of change...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fickletzeentch1;Ignorance is a disease that threatens to swallow the content or fearful, through the Master's gifts you see this now. Your mind is set aflame with knowledge beyond your years, which lights a fire inside you to seek out more and grasp at the infinite strands of your destiny and come to know where each might lead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fickletzeentch1A;I must adapt and grow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THE LORD OF SLAUGHTER
#
khornesstr0;Unlike the other gods, Khorne's followers do not go to great lengths to build temples in his honour. Instead, they worship their god on the battlefield. His followers also offer him praise and attempt to win his favour by savagely attacking each other when there are no other battles to be fought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khornesstr0a;Who dies first?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khornesstr1;While worship of most of the other gods requires rituals, altars, and sacrifices, Khorne's demands are simply that his followers spill fresh blood and collect skulls in his name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khornesstr1a;By Khorne, it will be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khornesstr1b;Sacrifice some cattle instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khornesstr2;Khorne's berserkers are unstable warriors who revel in battle and live only for the shedding of blood in his name. Only warriors who devote themselves utterly to the Lord of Slaughter and offer him a mountain of skulls are destined to become such warriors. Now a berserker stands before you, ready to offer you up to the Skull Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khornesstr2a;For the slaughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khornesstr2b;I have already proven my worth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BLOOD_FOR_THE_BLOOD_GOD;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SKULLS_FOR_THE_SKULL_THRONE;SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khornesstr3;You have killed a faithful servant of Khorne and now wear his skull as a trophy. You proudly claim to be a champion among men and that no mere mortal can best you, arousing the ire of Khorne, now he test your boasts and sends a vicious bloodletter daemon to do battle with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khornesstr3a;I am invincible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khornesstr3b;The foe is too strong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khornesstr4;You bellow your roar of triumph so that Khorne might take notice on you and grant you his blessing for your victory, and you are rewarded with a white hot pain that shoots through your body, giving you the strength of two men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khornesstr4a;My axe shall feast on the blood of my foes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# GREAT CORRUPTER
#
fathernurgle0;Crippled, you begin to brood over your existence, how short life is, how much longer you might have left on this world. Confident and hopeful you shake the fear from your mind, you are far to strong to be beaten by this set back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle0a;I will not let this beat me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle1;Your condition grows worse, perhaps it is more serious then you first thought, now fear makes a home in the confines of your mind as you being to feel a dark irrational presence envelop your mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle1a;I can't die, not... like this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle2;You still show no sign of your condition improving, your blood starts to boil, surely something is to blame for this. Your life feels so futile now that everything you aspired to has been ripped away, leaving you with a feeling of stagnant resentment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle2a;I was supposed to live forever in glory *cough* I was meant for so much more then this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle3;You hold onto every ounce of strength you can, maybe one of the gods still listens? What if you offered them gold, slaves, anything you own...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle3a;Gods... do not forsake me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle4;Your strength has deserted you, hope has abandoned you, all is lost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle4a;Is this really how I am to die, not with a roar, but with a whimper...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle5;You lie in your bed ready to accept your fate and let go, when a gargled voice resounds in your mind. "Give yourself unto the Lord of Decay and no more will you feel pain, no more shall you fear death, all things die, embrace your destiny with Grandfather Nurgle! Who other then Nurgle can protect you against the Rot, who but the Lord of Decay knows the true gift of immortality?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle5a;Plaguefather... deliver me from this existence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle5b;No, I am ready for this to end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle6;As the oath pass your lips you feel all the pain seep from your body, instead you are filled with what feels like joy, power, and warm sensation that spreads through your body... a warmth you long to share with the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle6a;I pledged myself to your service my Lord...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle7;You have forsaken your god, and now you close your eyes and await the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fathernurgle7a;I am prepared to meet my ancestors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

find_Pet_Daemonette;Seek to Summon a Daemonette.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_Pet_Daemonette_desc;Daemonettes seem both beautiful and repulsive to those who look upon them. Their bewitching opal eyes and enchanting aura veil their androgynous features and grotesque claws, forming an unnatural appearance the beholder will always consider the epitome of beauty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slaaneshbless0;Boredom has begun to plague you, a life of excess and carnal pleasures seem less fulfilling, even the exquisite pain of cold steel against your sensitive flesh no longer excites you. Then one night cruel & sensual echoes pull at the edge of your sanity, teasing you with forbidden thoughts that make you ache for something more. Somehow you know what you this path requires and so you set about gathering what you need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slaaneshbless0A;A couple hundred lashing to motivate my servants first...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slaaneshbless3;Your cult has gathered everything you need, the conditions are perfect and the winds of magic here are unstable enough that it is relatively easy for your efforts to tear through the thin veil of your world. Or perhaps it was someone else tearing through from the other side?  A pair of unworldly eyes glow at you from the other side of the tear in reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slaaneshbless3A;Come forth, dark angel and give me your name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slaaneshbless6;Lately, you have spent long sensual nights conversing with [From.GetFirstNameWithNick], your 'loyal' pet daemonette. At length you discussed the Dark Prince, the gardens of delight that sit just beyond this world, and how you should cease trying to master your desires. Wouldn't it be far better to let your desires claim mastery over you instead? Delving deeper into this realm of wonder and temptation is a path you can walk... together...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slaaneshbless6A;I will need a fresh supply of slaves to practice on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slaaneshbless6B;Only fools and pawns drown themselves in excess!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# BERSERKER EVENTS
#
berserker0;As the enemy draws near during the battle, it feels as if Khorne's gaze is upon you! A sudden uncontrollable blood-lust begins to swell within you, red hot with anger, you then raise your weapon and charge howling into the enemy ranks. Many of the cowards attempt to flee at the mere sight of you, but your axe has no mercy to spare for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker0A;Blood! Hahahahaha... BLOOD!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker1;Touched by the Blood God's gift of madness, you cleave the skull of yet another foe who dared stand before you. Another corpse for the pile, but as you turn to seek more blood to let flow, you notice a large spear sticking through your shoulder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker1A;I will have last blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker2;Touched by the Blood God's gift of madness, you split in twain yet another foe who thought to match you might. Another trophy for the pile, but as you turn to seek more blood, you notice an axe stuck in your back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker3;Your vision goes red as your rage completely takes over and you find yourself alone charging the enemy lines. As you swing your blade at the nearest enemy, an arrow burrows into your shoulder and two more dig into your chest. Spitting blood at your foes, you wield your fury like another weapon and cut down yet another foe before they surround you and hurl themselves at you like a pack of rabid dogs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker3A;So much blood...too much to drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker4;Your rage overwhelms you. Howling and snarling like a lunatic, you charge ahead without regard for your safety. As your nearest companions struggle to keep up, you surrender your will to Khorne and drown yourself in the blood and carnage that comes from meeting the enemy. When the dust settles, your retainers find you standing over a few dozen slain foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker4A;Uuuaaarrarraaargh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker5;You are having a heated argument with [beserker_victim.GetTitledFirstName], your bothersome courtier, when you feel the berserker rage rising within you. As [beserker_victim.GetFirstName] continues to babble about trivial concerns, you slam your fist down on the wooden table, cracking it under the strain. Soon your vision turns red as the familiar bloodlust is roused from its slumber...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker5A;I heard you the first time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker6;Your servants hurry towards the commotion they hear, only to see [beserker_victim.GetTitledFirstName] thrown through the door with torn clothes, several missing teeth and a face covered in cuts and swelling bruises. [beserker_victim.GetSheHeCap] runs away in mad panic as you struggle to calm down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker6A;It is done. Don't waste my time again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker7;[beserker_victim.GetTitledFirstName] continues to drone on as the berserker rage builds inside you, but with great effort you manage to channel your ire away from [beserker_victim.GetFirstName]. Your blade bites into the flesh of a nearby servant, and you begin to feel the rage slowly subsiding. [beserker_victim.GetFirstName] stills [beserker_victim.GetHerHis] breath and carefully reflects over his next words: my [Root.GetTitle]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berserker7A;I'll kill you next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_berserker.10;The battle around you rages on, your warriors pressing forward in a frenzy as you lay bleeding on the ground. The world is slowed to a crawl as the last moments of your life are filled with cries of rage and anguish, the clashing of steel and spilling of blood. You now notice a figure high above the battle, and an angel wreathed in flames and gore descends upon your broken body, eyes carrying a blood-lust more ravenous then any mortal. Valkia the Bloody has seen your warrior's death and come to claim your soul for the Halls of Khorne, where you shall become a handmaiden to the Blood God second only to the bride of Khorne herself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
