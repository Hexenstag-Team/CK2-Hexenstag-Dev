EVTTITLE_wh_cults_and_hunters_4;Slaves to Darkness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_4;You are playing with no protection from the influence of Chaos Cults and your character can be corrupted by their activity.\nIf you would prefer to cut out the narratives and directly join a cult, just find the cult's title (they're all de jure vassals to Be'lakor's Empire of Undivided title), then right-click on it and take the decision to join the cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_102;The [underground_cult_allegiance.GetName] always needs more support. What would you offer to your beloved Cult?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_102;I'll send money;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_wh_cults_and_hunters_102;I'll buy influence AND send money;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_wh_cults_and_hunters_102;I, um... I gave on the way in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_251;You have received an invitation to an exclusive event, a meeting of the most worthy people of [root.location.GetName] to implore the Gods for enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_251;This sounds very promising!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_251;This sounds deeply suspicious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPC_wh_cults_and_hunters_251;I should be helping the needy instead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_252;When you arrive at the meeting, you're surprised at some of the claims that the other attendees make about the character of the Gods. You begin to wonder if they really know what they're talking about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_252;Am I out of touch?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_252;No, it's the cultists who are wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_253_dark_secrets;Setting aside your misgivings, you participate in the rite. It is truly enlightening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_253;Finally the truth is revealed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_253;There's nothing like doing your own research;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_wh_cults_and_hunters_253;Even so, you're not convinced;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_261;You have received an invitation to an exclusive party, where all the most fabulous and beautiful people of [root.location.GetName] will gather!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_261;I should be helping the needy instead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_261;It wouldn't be a party without me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_wh_cults_and_hunters_261;Oh, whatever would I wear and what I would I say...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_262;You're glad you came! The refreshments are good and the company agreeable. But the party is going rather late and you've had your fill.
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_262;Stay and mingle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_262;Best not to over-do it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_263;Despite the late hour, the excitement of the event keeps you highly alert and you try to take advantage of the chance to mingle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_263_dangerous_excess;Despite the late hour, the excitement of the event keeps you... stimulated. You want to sample everything this event has to offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_263;And I still want more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_263;What a great night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_wh_cults_and_hunters_263;Then again, perhaps you shouldn't be here;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_271;While out late at night, you feel the hairs rising on the back of your neck. From the corner of your eye, you see the glint of moonlight on steel. Your life is in danger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_271;Run for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_271;Stand and fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_272;You fight bravely but your assailant is too fast and too strong. You suffer a cruel blow and fall. By the will of the Gods, the sound of voices approaching sees off your assailant before another blow falls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_272;That could have been worse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_273;You fight bravely but your assailant is too fast and too strong. You are struck down, but live to see the killer become a torturer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_273;Oh Shallya, why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_274;You more than match your assailant for skill and speed and the coward turns to flee. Thinking only to stop their senseless violence, you strike a mortal blow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_274_blood_addiction;Rage takes hold and you forget yourself, wallowing in the red heat of battle. When your head clears, your assailant is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_274;When I woke up this morning, I was feeling pretty dangerous;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_274;And the blood! The blood is so red.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_281;While out late at night, you feel the hairs rising on the back of your neck. A gang of ruffians emerge from the shadows with clubs raised.\n"Don't make this hard on yourself," the leader says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_281;Run away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_281;Stand and fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_282;Despite your best efforts, you have been abducted. Your captors explain the price you'll have to pay and the consequences for failing to cooperate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_282_cult_captive;Despite your best efforts, you have been abducted. Your captors explain that they mean you no harm - in fact, they say, their objective is to free you from a lie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_282;Do your worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_282;I'll pay your price;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_wh_cults_and_hunters_282;At last, I am free;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_283;The ruffians didn't mean to kill you, but they did. At least you won't have to suffer whatever horrible things they had planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_283;At least I die free;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_284;The gang of cowards who assaulted you never expected you to fight so fiercely. You scatter them with a few well-placed blows and have to stop yourself from chasing them through the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_284;That will teach them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_291;A filthy peasant attempts to accost you while you go about your business in [root.location.GetName]. The old man's rambling isn't as disturbing as the foul stench about him and you worry that he carries the miasma of disease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_291;See the poor wretch to a hospice and pay for his care;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_291;Get out of there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_wh_cults_and_hunters_291;Have your guards get rid of him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_292;You can't help thinking about that encounter with the diseased peasant. Will you get sick as well? Will the disease take your mind as well as your body? You struggle to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_292;Hope for the best;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_292;Seek out the peasant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_293;You take advice from your physician on how to protect yourself and seek out the old man again. He is not hard to find, and is happy to explain more about his condition...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_293;Yes. Yes, it's all so clear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_294;You take advice from your physician on how to protect yourself and seek out the old man again. You find him with a little difficulty and make him explain his condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_294;Ha! I'm safe after all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_294;Pay for his care at a hospice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_401;Disaster! Nefarious forces have burst out into the open and launched an open revolt in [root.GetName[.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_401;Rally our forces!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_501;Having decided to find a specialist Witch Hunter to lead the struggle against malign forces in your realm, you must now decide which sort of agent you're looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_501;A skilled adventurer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_501;A Myrmidian Inquisitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_wh_cults_and_hunters_501;A Knight of Bretonnia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_wh_cults_and_hunters_501;A Sigmarite Templar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_wh_cults_and_hunters_501;An Ice Witch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_wh_cults_and_hunters_501;An agent from a secretive order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_502;Hunters from these orders can be more effective in some situations, but they come with their own agendas. Which order do you wish to contact?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_502;The Order of the Shroud;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_502;The Order of the Scale and Sword;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_wh_cults_and_hunters_502;The Temple of Solkan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_wh_cults_and_hunters_502;Maybe a more conventional answer is best;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_wh_cults_and_hunters_503;Adventurer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_wh_cults_and_hunters_503;The witch hunter has arrived. [hunter_candidate.GetBestName] is a veteran warrior and skilled investigator. [hunter_candidate.GetSheHeCap] swears to protect your realm from unseen threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_wh_cults_and_hunters_503;The witch hunter has arrived. [hunter_candidate.GetBestName] is highly knowledgable and bold in the face of malign forces. [hunter_candidate.GetSheHeCap] swears to protect your realm from unseen threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_wh_cults_and_hunters_503;The witch hunter has arrived. [hunter_candidate.GetBestName] is a cunning spy who can see through the intrigues of your unholy enemies. [hunter_candidate.GetSheHeCap] swears to protect your realm from unseen threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_wh_cults_and_hunters_504;In Myrmidia's Name;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_504;The witch hunter has arrived. [hunter_candidate.GetBestName] is part of the Inquisition of Myrmidia. This holy order was founded in Estalia during the vampire Nourgoul's terrible War of Blood and has established itself as the foremost enemy of dark forces in the south of the Old World. [hunter_candidate.GetFirstName]'s chief weapon is surprise. And fear. Fear and surpise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_wh_cults_and_hunters_505;For the Lady;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_505;The witch hunter has arrived. [hunter_candidate.GetBestName] is a valiant Knight of Bretonnia. The Knights go back to the very founding of Bretonnia, when the warrior king Giles le Breton led his companions in a long war against chaotic and greenskin forces. [hunter_candidate.GetFirstName] has sworn an oath to destroy the minions of darkness no matter how well they hide themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_wh_cults_and_hunters_506;Blessed Sigmar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_506;The witch hunter has arrived. [hunter_candidate.GetBestName] is a ruthless Templar of Sigmar. [hunter_candidate.GetHerHisCap] order is rightly feared by the cultists, mutants and witches who threaten the Empire from within, as their ruthless zeal knows no bounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_wh_cults_and_hunters_507;Power of the Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_507;The witch hunter has arrived. [hunter_candidate.GetBestName] is a member of Kislev's sisterhood of Ice Witches and wields formidable magic. [hunter_candidate.GetSheHeCap]  favours you with a thing smile and pledges to defend the land you rule.\nYou would have been happier to hear [hunter_candidate.GetFirstName] swearing to defeat your enemies, but the Ice Witches are a law unto themselves at times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_wh_cults_and_hunters_508;Slayer of the Dead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_508;The witch hunter has arrived from the Temple of Morr. [hunter_candidate.GetBestName] is pale and unhealthy-looking, but [hunter_candidate.GetSheHe] moves gracefully and [hunter_candidate.GetHerHis] eyes are full of a quiet strength. [hunter_candidate.GetFirstName] bows before you and promises to root out any necromantic conspiracy in your realm, and you're sure that's true.\nBut what if your enemies are of another kind? The Order of the Shroud has little experience and hardly any interest in hunting down mutants and witches if no necromancy is involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_wh_cults_and_hunters_509;Verena's Justice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_509;The witch hunter has arrived from the temple of Verena. [hunter_candidate.GetBestName] kneels before you and swears to defend your land and its people to the best of [hunter_candidate.GetHerHis] ability. The templar's words ring with sincerity and you feel sure that you can trust [hunter_candidate.GetHerHim] to behave justly.\nBut is justice enough? Critics of the Order of the Sword and Scale often complain that their methods are too soft and allow troubles to grow unnecessarily. But unlike other hunters, the Verenans aren't even rumoured to kill innocents in their fight against evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_wh_cults_and_hunters_510;Solkan's Fury;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_510;The witch hunter has arrived from the temple of Solkan. [hunter_candidate.GetBestName] has been carefully trained by that ancient order to fight the Ruinous Powers. [hunter_candidate.GetSheHeCap] is eager to destroy the enemies of Solkan lurking in your realm.\nPerhaps a little too eager, at that. Solkanite Templars have a reputation for getting their job done no matter the cost, and it seems like [hunter_candidate.GetFirstName] is no exception to the rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_wh_cults_and_hunters_511;Emissary of Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_511;The witch hunter has arrived from the Temple of Solkan, but [hunter_candidate.GetSheHe] is not at all what you expected. [hunter_candidate.GetFirstName] is a mage from the far South, trained to channel the Light of the Law God in battle with the Ruinous Powers. [hunter_candidate.GetSheHeCap] locks your gaze with [hunter_candidate.GetHerHis] own and you can see the faint glow of power in the mage's eyes. [hunter_candidate.GetFirstName] solemnly intones, "I bring the Light."\nAll manner of questions fill your mind and you struggle to force them past your lips. But your will is not enough. You give a deep nod of acknowledgement and reply,;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_511;Banish the Darkness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_603;Your loyal Witch Hunter, [court_witchhunter.GetFirstName] reports that the initial investigation in [clue_county.GetName] is complete and with a bit of support the trials could be wound up in a few days.

EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_603;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wh_cults_and_hunters_603;I'm not made of money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_610;[court_witchhunter.GetBestName] is now hunting down the mutants, cultists, and witches who plague [clue_county.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_611;[court_witchhunter.GetBestName] has returned from [court_witchhunter.GetHerHis] mission to [clue_county.GetName]. The troubles are over and many suspected cultists have been dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_700;[court_witchhunter.GetBestName] brings charges against [courtier_accused_by_witch_hunter.GetBestName].

EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_702;You have been captured by the Witch Hunter [court_witchhunter.GetBestName]. Although you try to look away, the wizard's terrible eyes bore into yours. "Tell me everything you know. Everything!" he commands and his gaze becomes a radiant beam of light. You begin to speak but the words are lost to you. All that you feel is the searing touch of [court_witchhunter.GetFirstName]'s magic.\nWhen it finishes burning, you are no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wh_cults_and_hunters_702;Answer the hunter's questions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wh_cults_and_hunters_710;[court_witchhunter.GetFirstName] reports a significant breakthrough.
