war_bear_mount;War Bear Mount;;;;;;;;;;;;x
war_bear_mount_desc;There is no creature more important to the Kislevites than the bear. He is more than just the symbol of the land, a God, and a king; his image is more than just a rallying figure for armies and proud citizens. The bear shares his life with the people of the oblast and shares their struggles. When winters are harsh, he goes hungry just as they do. When spring comes again, he takes his young to the river to play just as they do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cold_one_mount;Cold One Mount;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cold_one_mount_desc;Cold Ones are rapacious predators, fuelled by a savage blood-lust that drives them to attack any warm-blooded creature that comes near. Cold Ones hunt in packs, and are perfectly capable of bringing down creatures many times their own size. They are found in many places but are most commonly seen on the continent known as the New World that lies just to the west of Ulthuan. Their habitats range from the tunnels and mountains under Hag Graef in the realms of the Dark Elves, all the way, hundreds of miles south, to the Lustrian jungles that are home to the Lizardmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
