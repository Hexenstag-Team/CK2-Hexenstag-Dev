BM_NEW_013;New in Hexenstag 0.1.3;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NEW_013_DESC;We're not perfect and this update had some real development problems. Planned content ran into delays, content intended for the next release got pushed forward, and there was a real scramble to get it out just late. But we're still proud of the new work. 0.1.3 adds the Engineers Guild and its dark mirror, the Mad Inventors. We also started to add a new Great Work system for the Dwarf Holds and Great Cities of the Old World.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start exploring this content, we recommend the following characters:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MAKE_IT_GREEN;New in "Make it Green";;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MAKE_IT_GREEN_DESC;One of the first content complaints about 0.1.3 was that Dwarf Holds taken over by Greenskins were left out. Fair enough, we weren't thrilled about it either! The "Make it Green" ModDB exclusive update aimed to right that wrong by adding the historical lost holds and systems that model Orcs and Goblins taking over the great works of other races. If you're not much of a greenie, that's OK, we wrote systems for taking back wonders from the Greenskins, too! We also took the time to redesign the building upgrades for Greenskin tribes, using Prestige as a mechanic for tracking the, um, "prestige" of Greenskin rulers and how willing orcs and goblins are to follow them into battle.\n\nThese are our suggested characters for exploring the new content:;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# CHARACTERS
#
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15005;Astragoth isn't new - he's over 2000 years old! But he's in a unique position to showcase the new content for 0.1.3. The Dawi Zharr empire in the Darklands got a major overhaul and playing its leader gives you best window into that. Even better, he's great candidate for joining the Mad Inventors and owns five of the new Great Works at the game start! Don't think we've done all your work for you, though. Each of those Great Works can be expanded up to ten levels, and the greatest of them only starts with 5.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_FABIO_DI_MIRAGLIANO;Prince Fabio di Miragliano;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_12601;If only we were starting twenty years earlier, you could play the legendary Cosimo di Miragliano and kickstart the Tilean Renaissance with Leonardo himself at your side! But the son of the great father's still in a great position. Miragiliano is one of the most advanced human cities and the di Miragliano bloodline has a unique and powerful benefit.\nForza Miragliano!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_OLEK_VLAGGARAD;King Olek Vlaggarad;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_14950;When researching for 0.1.3, our team discovered that the legacy files mistakenly drove the dwarfs out of Desolation Hold a couple of centuries too early. (The Hold actually fell a little before the Great War Against Chaos in the 2200s.) We've reinstated the Dawi Vlagaar in their rightful lands but it's up to you to remake Warhammer history.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_DIEGO_DE_AGUILAR;King Diego De Aguilar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_7652;Estalia didn't get a major facelift in 0.1.3, but their building and retinue choices did change. The Tercio doesn't exist in 2010 and gunpowder weapons are still rare. But with the De Aguilars you are in a fine position to unite your fractious country, pull the Tileans into line, and then when the Tercio system arrives in the late game? The sky's the limit!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_ODDBLUM_SKULL_CRAG;Warboss Oddblum;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1723;Ever had the urge to mess around with weird chemicals in the hope of improving your brain? No? Not even caffeine? Well, how about having your video game avatar do that on your behalf? Oddblum is nicely set up to join the Mad Inventors and show you what an RNG-driven bundle of swingy results it can be.\nNOTE: The Hexenstag team accepts no responsibility for damages to your goblin during this adventure. Proceed at your own risk. Bring your singing voice. Have a nice day!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_KNUBS_BLADETWISTER;Warboss Knubs Bladetwister;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1662;Cragmere might have only had one careless owner but it is quite the fixer-upper now. The lower levels are flooded with water, making its wealthy mines useless. Still... with enough goblinpower you could get that place going again, maybe assign some caverns to a nice fungal forest, perhaps even set up a Squigball Arena?\nIf only those blasted stunties would leave you alone to concentrate on home improvement!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_BRAK_RED_EYE;Warboss Brak Red Eye;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1651;Couldn't tempt you with Knubs and his fixer-upper, could I? OK, how about starting as the goblin leader of an occupied and functional dwarf hold? That's what you get with Brak- no, stop looking at Karak Eight-Peaks, it's not that great. Red Eye's where it's at. Just murder Skinraz to collect the Red Eye tribes under your enlightened leadership and you've got all kinds of enemies. We mean opportunities. Why would we say "enemies"?\nYou'll be fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_GURK_MEGABOSS;Gurk Megaboss;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1503;Gurk's been terrorizing the Badlands since the early days of Warhammer modding in CK2, but for some reason he never made it to the bookmark pages. So what better time than now? We've reworked Black Crag from the old, static "special building" into a dynamic Great Work and set Gurk on the path of conquest again.\nWAAAGH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_GRIMAND_DRAKENDRENGI;King Grimand Drakendrengi;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_14472;We've got a lot of spotlight on lost holds because the Dwarfs of the Old World have lost a lot of their homeland. But one youngster from the Jeweller's Guild managed to buck the trend and took back Karak Azgal, slaying a dragon on the way! Unfortunately, Skalf Drakendrengi's great achievement didn't totally solve the problem. Centuries on, his heirs preside over only the surface levels of a dilapidated hold and are forced to pay the nearby Kings of Karak Azul for protection. Maybe you can help them get moving again?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_CESARE_DI_SORRENTO;Doge Cesare Di Sorrento;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_13066;We know. He's not an orc or a goblin and Remas isn't that close to anyone green. But you know what else is green? That's right: Snotlings!\nAnd the sea. One of the sneaky little changes in "Make it Green" is the addition of a Bloodline for the great navigator, Marco Colombo. Now, the lore didn't tell us who is descended from Marco but he sailed around a lot and must have gotten lonely so we set up a "Plausible Bloodlines" game rule to give you some control of the consequences. If you like randomness, you can switch to the dynamic setup and let the game choose some AI patricians, then if you're playing a patrician with this rule, you'll get the option to take the bloodline after a few days. Or you can stick with the default option, which certainly wasn't made using the randomizing script. Either way, Cesare can be a Colombo descendant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
