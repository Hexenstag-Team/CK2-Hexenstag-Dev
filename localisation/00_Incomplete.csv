ripperdactyl_mount_desc;These unique and terrifying flying reptiles are extrememly aggressive. They have razor-sharp beaks, thick scales, and massive wings. They do not only kill for food, but for sport as well, making them all the more dangerous. Over the dense jungles of Lustria the Ripperdactyl fly, always on the lookout for their next kill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

carnosaur_mount_desc;As the apex predators of the lands of Lustria, these ferocious Saurians prowl the jungle searching for their next meal. Only the most hardened Saurus warriors manage to tame and ride these hulking creatures, although most die in their attempts. When these creatures roar they can be heard for miles around, and the jungle becomes still with fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bastiladon_mount_desc;The Bastiladons of Lustria are well known for their enormous size and weight. When threatened, they use their clubbed tail and horned skull to crush and stab their opponents. Their scaled bakcs can be used to mount the Holy weapons of the Lizardmen, such as a solar engine that can be used to smite any outsiders who dare to set foot in sacred Lustria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
stegadon_mount;Stegadon Mount;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
stegadon_mount_desc; The mighty Stegadons of Lustria have inhabited the forbidden jungles since long before the coming of the Old Ones. These ancient creatures will charge on anything that intrudes upon their habitat, no matter how fearsome. Their bulky horns allow them to pierce through even the thickest of hides. These are the workhorses of the Lizardmen, but are also fearsome in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
