found_imperial_engineer_school;Found the Imperial Engineers School;;;;;;;;;;;;x
found_imperial_engineer_school_desc;For centuries the Empire has relied on Dwarf engineering know-how. Certainly this arrangement has been profitable for both sides - but perhaps the time has come to set up a centre of learning for human engineers, similar to those found in Tilea?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
found_imperial_engineer_school_tt;For the cost of 1000 gold, we will hire an inventive genius and construct a school for his work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
engineer_training;Become an Engineer;;;;;;;;;x
engineer_training_desc;Up until now, you've only been a dabbler, an observer in the Engineer's Guild. Are you prepared to become a true Engineer?;;;;;;;;;x
engineer_training_power_desc;Enables a decision for guild members to gain the Engineer trait.;;;;;;;;;x
dwarf_engineer_training;Become a Dwarf Engineer;;;;;;;;;x
dwarf_engineer_training_desc;Lad, you've been a good apprentice Engineer and could go far. So stop mucking around like a faithless Elf and apply yourself!;;;;;;;;;x
dwarf_engineer_training_power_desc;Enables a decision for dwarf engineers to gain the Dwarf Engineer trait.;;;;;;;;;x
dwarf_master_engineer_training;Become a Dwarf Master Engineer;;;;;;;;;x
dwarf_master_engineer_training_desc;You've served out five decades in good standing with the Guild, a fair time to earn the title of master. Time to become a true engineer!;;;;;;;;;x
dwarf_master_engineer_training_power_desc;Allows Dwarfs who have been members of the society for 50 years to gain the Dwarf Master Engineer trait.;;;;;;;;;x
deploy_war_machines;Deploy War Machines;;;;;;;;;x
deploy_war_machines_desc;Every good engineer has a few contraptions to unleash in times of crisis. You're a great engineer.;;;;;;;;;x
deploy_war_machines_tt;These war machines won't be good for more than one war, but they'll get the job done!;;;;;;;;;x
deploy_war_machines_power_desc;Allows master engineers to create short-lived war machines to destroy their enemies!;;;;;;;;;x
economic_engineering;Engineering improvements;;;;;;;;;;;;x
economic_engineering_desc;Use your engineering expertise to decrease local construction costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
economic_engineering_power_desc;Enables an option to right-click on your county titles and spend society currency on a short-term reduction on building costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
engineering_improvements;Engineering improvements;;;;;;;;;;;;x
engineering_improvements_desc;This province is benefiting from the work of an engineer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
engineer_experiment;Experiment!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
engineer_experiment_power_desc;Allows engineers to take a few risks to further their knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
engineer_experiment_desc;Enough reading and replicating well-tested devices. The time has come to try something bold, something new, something potentially suicidal!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
engineer_experiment_tt;What could go wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
impractical_innovation;Impractical Innovation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
impractical_innovation_desc;This engineer's latest invention doesn't have a lot of practical use - for now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
practical_innovation;Practical Innovation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
practical_innovation_desc;This engineer's latest invention is useful in the near future. Maybe they will set sights higher next time?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
busy_engineer;Busy Engineer;;;;;;;;;;;;x
busy_engineer_desc;This engineer is busy with a major project and has no time for any other technical work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_dK_engineers_10;You've had ideas for something special for a while now, so it doesn't take long to draw up a blueprint and assemble the materials for a prototype.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_dK_engineers_10;Next step: field testing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_dK_engineers_10_TT;You have a good feeling about this one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_dK_engineers_11;There's no reward without risk. That's why your latest experiment is incredibly, insanely risky. The reward? If you survive, you should learn something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_dK_engineers_11;That's a big "if";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_dK_engineers_12;Sometimes a concept just doesn't work. You've tried and tried, but you can't get this device to work with the materials available to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_dK_engineers_12;Back to the drawing board.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_dK_engineers_13;You know, this is something people could use today. Regular people, not just engineers and desperate men. It might not be the kind of thing you can brag about during guild meetings, but your new device is going to make difficult lives just a little easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_dK_engineers_13;That's why I got into engineering!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_dK_engineers_14;Your prototype is a marvel! It's brilliant! It's ahead of its time! In fact, it's so advanced that nobody is going to be using it until well after you're dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_dK_engineers_14;A true genius is never appreciated in their own lifetime;;;;;;;;;;;;x
