# ASRAI GOVERNMENTS
#
eternal_court_government;Eternal Court;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
eternal_court_government_desc;The Asrai live in a harmonious co-existance with the denizers of Athel Loren, but are known for their frivolous and sometimes savage behavior.

# ASUR GOVERNMENTS
#
highborn_government;Highborn Concordate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
highborn_government_desc;The High Elves rely on a mild form of autocracy, centered on cities rather than fortresses. While the elven Princes are respected and obeyed and pass down their titles by blood, they are required to treat properly all their highborn subjects. Elven rulers cannot imprison any of their subjects without a proper reason and cannot revoke titles from their elven vassals, except in some extreme circumstances. In return, they have absolutely no obligations in regards of their inferior non-elven subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
everqueen_government;Court of the Everqueen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
everqueen_government_desc;The court of the Everqueen moves through Avelorn from place to place like a great carnival, pitching silken pavilions of myriad colours wherever it halts. By day, silver laughter rings through the forest as the Elves make sport. By night, faery lights flicker in the darkness, drifting behind the Everqueen's courtiers and illuminating the revels and feasting. With its perfect weather, bountiful forests and beautiful near-immortal inhabitants Avelorn seems the sort of rustic paradise of which mortal men can only dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

chaos_host_government;Chaos Host;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_host_government_desc;Out of all the many threats that the Old World must face, none strikes such fear and misery into the hearts of Men like the Followers of Chaos. Slaves to darkness all, they have given themselves wholly to the Ruinous Powers, some willingly, others because they felt they had no other choice. Chaos itself is a corrupting influence upon the world, like a dark, malign cancer that eats at the minds of all those that live within the World. No single race, no matter how noble or powerful, will ever be safe from their barbaric invasions, nor are they safe from the seductive whispers of the Dark Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# DAWI GOVERNMENTS
#
dwarf_government;Dwarfish Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarf_government_desc;"The Dwarfs base their feudal-like government upon millennia-old traditions. Usually, Dwarf rulers ""lease"" lands to their subjects, as well as the clan halls, forges, and mines in them. In turn, the subjects must provide back a proportion of all gold and precious minerals extracted from the leased lands, and a levy is placed upon their holds. The Dwarfs are highly isolationist and bear little love for surface-dwellers, but they maintain great respect towards their own.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
