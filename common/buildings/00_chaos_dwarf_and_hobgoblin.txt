### Chaos Dwarfs and Hobgoblins ###
# NOTE: Castle, City, and Temple are for Chaos Dwarfs, Tribal for Hobgoblins
# Faction identity:
# Chaos Dwarfs in the lore do not make many conquests, so their buildings can be slanted to defence.
# They also need longer building chains to make the player feel like they have an alternative to expansion.
# Longer building times make sense for a long-lived race.
# To balance this, they get a cost reduction rather than stronger effects. (Stronger effects AND more levels would be too good!)



### Chaos Dwarf Fortress ###

# Bleak and depressing place to live

# Overall levy is grounded in HI/melee with some screens
# Shouldn't specialize in levy_reinforce_rate because they are not a numerous people
