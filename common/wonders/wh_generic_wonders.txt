### Help for new modders ###
#
# Vanilla used specific wonder items for its historical great works because they were all 'one offs'.
# But in Hexenstag, the wonder items represent classes of special areas in the Old World.
# In addition, Hexenstag is a work constantly in development. Future modders (maybe even you!)
# will have to work with these wonders and might want to change the available upgrades for some class.
# It is much easier to change the available upgrades for one item than it is to make the same upgrade
# for sixteen items.
#
# When adding a wonder (or converting a vanilla special building into a wonder), follow these steps:
# 0. Read the full instructions before beginning. This will save your time, rather than waste it.
# 1. Check lore details, confirming FROMFROMFROM and getting the best construction dates possible.
# 	a. Estimates will often be required.
# 2. Check the developed generic wonders to find the best match.
# 	a. In the rare case that no close match exists, you may need to script a new class of wonder.
# 3. Find the appropriate province file in the \history\provinces\ folder.
#		a. Add a new date entry corresponding to the construction of the wonder, or 1.1.1 for wonders pre-Sigmar.
#		b. Add the 'build_wonder = <wonder_type> command inside that date entry, replacing <wonder_type> with the
#			 id of the new wonder.
#		c. Use the 'set_wonder_stage = X' command inside the date entry, replacing X with the correct number of stages
#			 that the wonder should have at its first appearance. (Usually the right number of stages is based on the
#			 number of upgrades that the wonder will have at that point in its life.)
#		d. For each upgrade that the wonder should have, use the 'build_wonder_upgrade = <upgrade_type>' command. As
#			 with the build_wonder command, replace <upgrade_type> with the id of the upgrade.
#		NOTE: You can refer to file 478 - Zharr-Naggrund.txt for an example of this initial entry.
# 4. If information exists for charting the life of the wonder and showing when upgrades or new stages were built,
#		 this can be scripted into the province history file as well. Just add a new date entry for each group of changes
#		 and use the set_wonder_stage and build_wonder_upgrade commands described in steps 3c and 3d to add these details.
# 5. Open CK2 using your newly modded files to check that the wonder has appeared. At this stage its name and description
#		 will appear unlocalized as something like 'wonder_type' and 'wonder_type_desc'.
#		 a. If the wonder has not appeared, you only have one file to debug - the history file which you just edited. Check that
#			  the brackets close correctly (this is a common problem even for fairly experienced modders), then confirm that there
#			  are no typos in the commands.
#		 b. If everything seems in order but the wonder still won't load properly, it is best to ask someone more knowledgeable
#			  for help at this point.
# 6. Once the wonder is appearing correctly, it is time to set the name. You will need to open the file wh_wonder_names_and_descriptions.txt
#		 in the folder \common\scriped_effects\.
#		 a. Look for the wonder_naming_and_describing_effect. (At the time of writing, it's the only effect in the file.) You should find a comment identifying it as the scripted effect that sets up wonder names and descriptions.
#		 b. Scroll down and look for the comment identifying where new entries should be added.
#		 NOTE: If there is no comment, someone has deleted it and they should be ashamed of themselves, but you can still find the correct
#				place for the two closing brackets that end the effect. Please add a new line above the first of those brackets and restore the comment
#				by adding a hashtag and a short note.
#		 c. Add a new line above the comment. Check the province id for the province your wonder is located in. It's the number at the
#				start of the province filename. (So in our example of Zharr-Naggrund, the id is 478.) Match up with the indent for the comment, then
#				open an entry for the province by typing its id into the new line, followed by the equals and opening curly bracket as normal.
#		 d. Add a new line, increase the indent and change scopes to the wonder using, wonder = {
#		 e. Add a new line, increase the indent, and set the wonder's name by typing, set_name = "<your_wonder_name>" . <your_wonder_name>
#			  should be replaced by EITHER:
#				i. The actual text to be displayed in game, within quotation marks. For example, "Zharr-Naggrund".
#				ii. A localization key. This is the preferred style and if you're replacing a special building there should alrady be a localization
#					  key associated with it. Whatever the source of the key, be sure not to add any quotation marks and just have it follow the equals sign.
#		 f. Add a new line and maintain the current indent, then set the wonder's description by typing,
#				set_description = <your_wonder_description>. <your_wonder_description> should be replaced by EITHER:
#				i. The actual text to be displayed in game, within quotation marks. For example, "Zharr-Naggrund is a pretty cool place".
#				ii. A localization key, typically ending in _desc. As with the localization key for the wonder name, be sure not to use quotation marks.
#				NOTE: Usually localization keys use easily associated terms, with the description key just adding _desc to the name key's id.
#			g. Add a new line, decrease the indent, and close the wonder scope with a closing curly bracket.
#			h. Add a new line, decrease the indent, and close the province command with a closing curly bracket.
#	7. Save your work and start a new game using your modded files. The new name and description should be applied.
#		a. If the details are not correctly displayed, open up the ledger and go to the Great Works tab to check if other wonders are
#			 affected. If they are, it is probably best to revert your change to wh_setup_events.txt altogether and try again.
#		NOTE: If this has happened more than once, it is time to ask for help.
#		b. If only your wonder has a problem, you should be able to debug by checking that the brackets open and close correctly and that
#			 the text is free of typos. If the name displays correctly but the description does not, check the entry corresponding to the
#			 localization key. (Or ask the person who gave you the localization key to help sort this out.)
# 8. Once the wonder is displaying correctly with its proper name and description, pat yourself on the back for helping the mod grow!
